## Issue: Empty Content in Processed Files
**Date:** 2025-01-09
**Status:** FIXED âœ“

### Problem
The data preparer was producing nearly empty processed JSON files with no content, particularly for book chapters from Practical Guide to Interventional Pulmonology, PAPOIP, and BACADA.

### Root Cause
The raw JSON files from books use a different structure than journal articles:
- **Books**: Content stored in `text_chunks` array with each chunk having a `text` field
- **Articles**: Content stored in `sections` array with `title` and `content` fields

The data preparer was only looking for `sections` and missing the `text_chunks` structure.

### Solution Applied

1. **Updated path resolution** in `data_preparer_v12.py`:
   - Changed from relative paths to absolute paths using project root
   - Ensures script works when run from any directory

2. **Enhanced content extraction** in `_build_content()` method:
   - Added detection for `text_chunks` structure
   - Extracts and concatenates all chunk texts
   - Falls back to `sections` for journal articles
   - Maintains backward compatibility

3. **Updated text extraction** in `_get_all_sections_text()` method:
   - Checks for `text_chunks` first
   - Falls back to `sections` 
   - Ensures domain/doc_type classification works for all formats

4. **Similar fixes** applied to `chunk.py` for consistent path handling

### Verification
Tested on 10 files including both books and articles:
- Book chapters now extract 30-50k characters of content
- Journal articles continue to work correctly
- All metadata (authority tier, domain, etc.) properly assigned

### Files Modified
- `/src/prep/data_preparer_v12.py`
- `/src/index/chunk.py`

### Next Steps
Run full data preparation with:
```bash
make prep  # Will process all 460 files
```
