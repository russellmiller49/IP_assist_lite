Primary spontaneous pneumothorax describes patients develop\u00ad ing pneumothorax in the absence of trauma, with no underlying established lung pathology, and occurs in in approximately 3000 patients per year in the UK. 1,2 Some patients can be managed conservatively with close obser\u00ad vation, 3,4 but many symptomatic patients require an inter\u00ad vention to re\u00adexpand the lung. Current British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines suggest that aspiration of trapped air using a cannula and syringe should be considered, but more than 50% of patients subsequently require the inser\u00ad tion of a chest tube, which is then attached to an underwater seal drainage system. 4 The mean duration of hospitalisation of patients admitted for drainage is 6-8 days. 5\nAmbulatory management of patients with primary spon\u00ad taneous pneumothorax potentially removes the need for\nlong hospital admission by facilitating outpatient treatment. Reducing the need for chest tubes with bulky underwater systems might allow patients to remain mobile and facilitate early discharge with the device in situ. Ambulatory devices generally incorporate a Heimlich (one\u00adway) valve, which replaces the traditional underwater seal, either by in\u00ad line attachment to a standard chest tube or as part of an integrated device. However, the efficacy and safety of this approach has yet to be rigorously assessed. A systematic review 6 of the literature found that 18 studies describing ambulatory management of both spontaneous and iat\u00ad rogenic pneumothorax reported an overall success rate of 86% and successful outpatient management in 78% of cases, with few complications. Unfortunately, the available evidence was described as poor quality with a high risk of bias, including two inadequately powered random\u00ad ised trials and several retrospective case series. 6\nLancet 2020; 396: 39-49\nSee Comment page 4 Oxford Centre for Respiratory Medicine (R J Hallifax PhD) and Oxford Respiratory Trials Unit (M Laskawiec-Szkonter MA, Prof N M Rahman PhD) , University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Royal Berkshire National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, Reading, UK (E McKeown MRCP) ; Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK (P Sivakumar MRCP, A West MRCP) ; Queen Margaret Hospital, NHS Fife, Dunfermline, UK (I Fairbairn MRCP) ; Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust, Bath, UK (C Peter MRCP) ; Western General Hospital, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK (A Leitch PhD) ; West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Watford, UK (M Knight MRCP) ; Great Western Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Swindon, UK (A Stanton MRCP) ; University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, Lancaster, UK (A Ijaz MBBS) ; Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK (Prof S Marciniak PhD) ; North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK (J Cameron FRCEM, J E Harvey MD) ; Blackpool Fylde and Wyre Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Blackpool, UK (A Bhatta FRCP) ; Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, UK (K G Blyth MD) ; Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK (K G Blyth) ; Kettering General Hospital, Kettering, UK (R Reddy FRCP) ; Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK (M-C Harris FCEM) ; University Hospitals of North Midlands, Stoke-on-Trent, UK (N Maddekar MRCP) ; Academic Respiratory Unit, University of\nBristol, Bristol, UK\nThe Randomised Ambulatory Management of Primary Pneumothorax (RAMPP) trial was done to determine whether ambulatory management of patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax is safe and reduces the length of hospitalisation.\n\n## tudy design\n\nThe RAMPP trial was a multicentre, open\u00adlabel, random\u00ad ised controlled trial comparing ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax with standard care based on national guidelines. 4 Participants were screened and recruited from 24 hospitals in the UK with a track record of recruiting to trials and a strong link between emergency and respiratory departments. Study oversight was provided by the trial steering committee and an independent data monitoring committee, and ethical approval was provided by the UK National Research Ethics Service Committee (15/SC/0240). The trial protocol can be found online and in the appendix (pp 9-47). 7\n\n## articipants\n\nEligible patients had presented with a symptomatic spontaneous pneumothorax (confirmed by a chest radio\u00ad graph or CT scan) and were aged 16-55 years (as per BTS definition). Once a patient was identified as having a primary spontaneous pneumothorax, the decision to intervene was made on the basis of current BTS guidelines: patients were enrolled if they had a large pneumothorax (\u22652 cm interpleural distance at the level of the hilum) or significant symptoms, or both. Patients were ineligible if they had known or suspected underlying lung disease (including >20 pack\u00adyear tobacco smoking history, but excluding well controlled asthma), evidence of tension pneumothorax (defined as clinical or radiographic evidence of significantly increased intra\u00ad pleural pressure causing haemodynamic compromise that requires urgent decompression), or a contraindication\nto thoracic procedure as determined by the responsible physician, or if they were pregnant or lactating. Patients requiring intervention could be enrolled and randomly assigned up to 24 h after presentation, provided that they remained hospitalised with an ongoing symptomatic pneumothorax despite initial intervention (eg, patients treated initially with aspiration and observed overnight) requiring chest tube insertion. Patients not requiring an intervention were invited to participate in an observational cohort up to 2 weeks after their initial presentation, the results of which will be published separately. All partic\u00ad ipants in the current study provided written informed consent.\n\n## andomisation and masking\n\nPatients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either insertion of an ambulatory device (Rocket Pleural Vent, Rocket Medical, Watford, UK) or standard care (aspiration, standard chest tube insertion, or both) as per BTS guidelines. 4 Randomisation was done through a cen\u00ad tralised, web\u00adbased system using a computer\u00adgenerated minimisation algorithm. The minimisation factors were the recruiting centre and size of pneumothorax at presentation (\u22654 cm vs <4 cm at the level of the hilum on chest radiograph). The study was necessarily open label, with both patients and physicians aware of treatment allocation.\n\n## rocedures\n\nPatients in the experimental arm had an ambulatory device inserted using sterile technique with up to 3 mg/kg lido\u00ad caine as local anaesthetic. The device was inserted either in the anterior mid\u00adclavicular line (second intercostal space) or mid\u00adaxillary line (fifth intercostal space) according to investigator preference and clinical requirement. The ambulatory device used was an 8F gauge catheter attached to a self\u00adcontained, one\u00adway Heimlich valve and fluid collection chamber (appendix p 1). Researchers and local clinicians were trained to insert the device by the trial\n(S Walker MBChB, Prof N Maskell MD) ; University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust, Plymouth, UK (J P Corcoran MRCP) ; Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK (S Gerry MSc, C Roberts MSc) ; and Institute for Global Health, University College London, London, UK\n(Prof R F Miller FRCP)\nCorrespondence to: Dr Rob J Hallifax, Oxford Centre for Respiratory Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7LE, UK\nrobert.hallifax@ndm.ox.ac.uk\n\n## vidence before this study\n\nA search of PubMed and MEDLINE for articles on ambulatory management of pneumothorax published up to Dec 5, 2019, with the keywords 'pneumothorax', 'ambulatory', 'Heimlich valve', and 'outpatient' showed that most studies were case series and included two small, inadequately powered randomised trials. In 2013, a systematic review of 18 studies found that although ambulatory options might be successful, the data were of poor quality with a high risk of bias. A further three case series were subsequently published. Given this uncertain evidence base, we designed the Randomised Ambulatory Management of Primary Pneumothorax trial as a controlled study to determine whether ambulatory management of patients with primary spontaneous\npneumothorax reduces the length of hospitalisation and is safe.\n\n## dded value of this study\n\nThis study, which to our knowledge is the only large randomised trial of its kind, found that ambulatory management of patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax significantly reduces the length of hospitalisation compared with standard care. Ambulatory patients had fewer pleural procedures, but serious adverse events were higher because of hospital re-admission.\n\n## mplications of all the available evidence\n\nThis trial challenges the current guidelines for management for patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax, with the proviso that some patients will require further treatment.\nSee Online for appendix\ncoordinator or local Principal Investigator. Following device insertion, patients were observed for 1-2 h to assess them for clinical stability, after which a chest radiograph was done (appendix p 44).\nIf the chest radiograph showed insufficient lung re\u00ad expansion, the ambulatory device remained in situ and the patient was discharged, as long as the prespecified criteria of fitness for discharge were fulfilled. These criteria consisted of all of the following: the patient agreed, had clinically stable cardiorespiratory observations, had no increase in the size of pneumothorax since the last radiograph or review, did not require oxygen or other respiratory support, was mobile and able to self\u00adcare, was provided with written information on point of contact and follow\u00adup plan, and lives with a responsible person at home. Any patient not meeting these criteria remained hospitalised and was reviewed daily. Sufficient lung re\u00ad expansion was defined as complete or almost complete re\u00adexpansion (<1 cm rim of air apically on chest radiograph) and being unable to aspirate air through the device using a connector and syringe.\nIf discharged home with the device in situ, patients were reviewed as an outpatient every 1-2 days (generally daily, but a single review during the weekend was sufficient if clinically stable) until day 4, at which stage the patient should be considered for thoracic surgery. The timing of the ongoing outpatient review after day 4 was at the discretion of the responsible clinician. After each review, if there was sufficient re\u00adexpansion of the lung and no ongoing air leak, the device was removed and the patient was discharged. A postremoval chest radiograph was done to ensure that the lung had not recollapsed. If the chest radiograph showed recurrence of pneumothorax, the patient was rehospitalised for observation and consideration of the placement of a standard chest tube connected to an underwater seal.\nPatients who were in the control arm received standard treatment as per the 2010 BTS Pleural Guidelines. 4 In brief, pleural aspiration (if the clinician deemed it appropriate) was attempted under local anaesthetic using a 14-16 gauge cannula and syringe, aspirating a maximum of 2\u00b75 L. The patient was observed for 1-2 h to assess for clinical stability, and a repeat chest radiograph was done. If the repeat chest radiograph showed sufficient lung re\u00ad expansion, the patient was discharged. If the lung had not sufficiently re\u00adexpanded, then a small\u00adbore chest tube (\u226414 F) was inserted and attached to an underwater seal, and the patient was admitted to hospital.\nAlthough initial aspiration was recommended in the trial protocol, the responsible clinician was able to proceed directly to chest tube insertion and admission at their discretion, in line with BTS guidelines. 4 Decisions regarding chest tube removal were as per standard practice at participating centres but included no further air leak (as shown by a non\u00adbubbling chest tube) and full lung expansion on chest radiograph. A postremoval chest radiograph was done to ensure that the lung had not\nrecollapsed. Fitness for discharge criteria were assessed daily to provide equality between treatment groups. Evidence for the use of suction in patients with pneu\u00ad mothorax is poor. BTS guidelines suggest that high volume, low pressure suction should not be routinely used but could be considered if there is prolonged air leak. 4 Use of suction was at the discretion of the local responsible clinician.\nPatients were followed up at 1 week after the completion of treatment, and 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after randomisation. Hospital admissions and pneumothorax recurrence were measured up to the day 30 follow\u00adup point, and at each follow\u00adup point, data were collected on further hospital admissions, pain and breathlessness visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, quality of life, and smoking status. Patients who were not able to attend face\u00adto\u00adface follow\u00adup appointments were contacted by telephone to check for complications or recurrence, and if this was not possible, data on recurrence was collected through hospital or general practitioner medical records. Data on pneumothorax recurrence at 6 and 12 months will be presented separately with data from the obser\u00ad vational cohort.\n\n## utcomes\n\nThe primary outcome was the total length of hospital stay up to 30 days after randomisation, including initial hospital stay and re\u00adadmissions. Patients remaining in hospital overnight were recorded as having a 1\u00adday stay; those discharged on the same day (either after successful needle aspiration treatment or discharge with the ambulatory device) were recorded as zero length of stay. The 30\u00adday point was chosen on the basis of previous data suggesting that most conservatively treated (non\u00ad surgical) primary spontaneous pneumothorax air leaks resolve within 14 days of initial treatment, 8 and thus outcomes measured at 30 days were considered reliably to capture all related re\u00adadmissions. Patients with missing data at 1 week after treatment or 30 days after randomisation were assumed to have no re\u00adadmissions. Re\u00adadmission was defined as the need for emergency (non\u00adplanned) admission to hospital for any reason in relation to pneumothorax but was not restricted to the requirement for a further pleural intervention. Any re\u00ad admission to hospital was recorded as at least a 1\u00adday stay. Planned day case reviews for outpatient treated patients were not included.\nSecondary outcomes included the need for a further pleural procedure, adverse events, pain and breath\u00ad lessness VAS scores, recurrence rates, and time o/uniFB00 work because of pneumothorax treatment. Further pleural procedures were defined as any intervention that punctured the pleura (eg, chest drain insertion) after a first treatment intervention. We obtained a daily record of thoracic pain and breathlessness scores using a VAS score up to day 4 after randomisation, which was measured on a scale of 0 to 100 mm. A score of 0 indicated\nthe complete absence of symptoms and 100 was the maximum possible level of symptoms, which is validated for assessment of breathlessness in patients having pleural procedures. 9,10 VAS scores were also recorded on completion of treatment. Because patients could be discharged with a small residual pneumothorax, those with a persistent small pneumothorax at 1\u00adweek follow\u00ad up were defined as having ongoing pneumotho rax rather than a new occurrence. The recurrence of pneumotho\u00ad rax was defined as a new episode of symptomatic pneumothorax after full resolution on chest radiograph, or occurring after the 1\u00adweek follow\u00adup visit. Several other secondary outcomes including quality of life questionnaires (EuroQol\u00ad5D\u00ad5L), blood parameters, and digital air flow analysis are planned for separate publications.\nConcerning the failure of medical treatment, there is no robust evidence on the optimal timing for surgical intervention in primary spontaneous pneumothorax after initial treatment in the presence of ongoing air leak. Current BTS guidelines suggest that cases of persistent air leak or non\u00adre\u00adexpansion should be referred for surgery after 3-5 days. 4 To achieve objective outcomes for this study, the following criteria were developed to ensure\nconsistent practice in both groups, and were recorded in all cases. Referral for thoracic surgery occurred in the presence of all of the following: (1) persistent air leak on day 4 after insertion of chest tube (as measured by bubbling chest tube attached to an underwater seal) or evidence of ongoing air leak through the ambulatory device; (2) persis\u00ad tent pneumothorax on chest radiograph; (3) patient agreed to have surgery; and (4) no contraindication to thoracic surgery.\nSafety data were collected for all patients at each trial visit regarding adverse events, with seriousness defined as per Good Clinical Practice guidelines. 11 Expected adverse events were pain at the drainage site, minor haemorrhage not requiring specific intervention (eg, blood transfusion or surgery), subcutaneous emphysema, pleural infection, unintentional removal (falling out) of the Pleural Vent or chest tube, recurrence of pneumothorax or worsening of ongoing pneumothorax (if evidence of failure of full resolution following initial intervention), re\u00adexpansion pulmonary oedema, and the need for further (non\u00ad emergency) pleural procedures. Expected serious adverse events included tension pneumothorax occurring during treatment, blockage of chest tube with clinical con\u00ad sequences (eg, patient unwell or further procedure required), major intrathoracic haemorrhage requiring specific intervention (eg, blood transfusion), and any additional emergency pleural procedure as deemed necessary by the local investigator (eg, large bore chest tube insertion). Because the recurrence of pneumothorax is common and expected (occurring in about 33% of primary spontaneous pneumothorax cases within 1 year 1,12 ), recurrence was not reported as a serious adverse event. Adverse events were assessed locally, and, if they fulfilled the criteria for a serious adverse event, 13 they were reported immediately (ie, within 24 h) to the Oxford Respiratory Trials Unit for review. All serious adverse events were followed until resolution.\n\n## tatistical analysis\n\nThe statistical analysis was approved by the trial stat\u00ad isticians and steering committee before data analysis. The sample size for the primary outcome was determined to detect a di/uniFB00erence in length of hospital stay of 2\u00b73 days: from a mean of 4 days admission in patients receiving standard care to an expected mean of 1\u00b77 days in patients receiving ambulatory care (standard deviation in both groups 6\u00b70). The sample size calculation included a correction factor for non\u00adnormal data. These estimates assume that up to 50% of patients receiving standard care were expected to be successfully treated with aspiration alone (ie, zero\u00adday admission). It was assumed, conser\u00ad vatively, that about 20% of patients in the ambulatory care arm would require re\u00adadmission. Based on these param\u00ad eters, with 80% power, a 5% two\u00adsided significance level, and a 10% attrition rate, the study required 236 patients. Previous pleural studies have shown an attrition rate for the primary outcome measure of less than 5%. 14-16\n\n## igure 1: Trial profile\n\nThe Mann\u00adWhitney U test was used for the primary analysis. The median hospital stay (expected to be non\u00ad normally distributed) was calculated for each group, and the 95% confidence interval for median di/uniFB00erence was calculated using an exact method. Pre\u00adplanned sensitivity analyses were done to assess the robustness of the primary outcome. Survival analysis techniques were used to compare time to discharge between the two groups using the Gehan\u00adBreslow\u00adWilcoxon test (more appropriate than the log\u00adrank test because of a high early event rate in primary spontaneous pneumothorax) and using Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate a hazard ratio and associated 95% confidence interval. An analysis of hospital stay in hours (instead of whole days) was done using identical methods to the primary analysis. The Student's t test was used to compare mean di/uniFB00erences in length of stay.\nA worst\u00adcase scenario sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome was done by assigning the longest possible initial hospital day to those patients who were missing follow\u00adup forms in the ambulatory care arm.\nContinuous secondary outcome measures were analysed using ANCOVA adjusting for baseline scores. The adjusted mean di/uniFB00erence between treatment arms was calculated with 95% confidence interval and p values. Categorical secondary outcome measures were analysed using the \u03c72 test. Time\u00adto\u00adevent secondary outcome measures were analysed in the same way as time\u00adto\u00adevent analysis of the primary outcome measure.\nPrespecified subgroup analyses of the primary outcome were done for gender, previous pneumothorax, and tobacco and marijuana smoking history (ever vs never),\nusing tests of interaction in Cox regression models for the primary outcome. All results are reported in concordance with CONSORT standards. 17 All analyses were done using Stata (version 15, StataCorp 2017, USA).\nThe trial was prospectively registered with the International Standard Randomised Clinical Trials Number ISRCTN79151659.\n\n## ole of the funding source\n\nNeither of the funding sources were involved in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\n## esults\n\nWe recruited patients between August 27, 2015, and March 12, 2019. After approaching 776 potentially eligible patients, we reached our target of 236 (30%) participants, of whom 117 were assigned to ambulatory care and 119 to\nstandard care (Figure 1). The mean age at recruitment was 30 years (SD 8). 193 (82%) patients were male, 58 (25%) had a history of previous pneumothorax, and 20 (8%) had a family history (first\u00addegree or second\u00addegree relative) of pneumothorax (Table 1). 161 (68%) patients were current or former tobacco smokers, with a median pack\u00adyear history for both groups combined of 8 (IQR 5-12), and 114 (48%) were current or former marijuana smokers (Table 1). Most patients were symp tomatic with either chest pain (213 [90%]) or shortness of breath (210 [89%]).\nFor the primary outcome, we analysed 114 (97%) of 117 patients who received ambulatory care and 113 (95%) of 119 who received standard care, because data was not available for the remaining patients. Among those who had ambulatory care, the median hospital stay in the first 30 days was 0 days [IQR 0-3], which was significantly lower than in those who received standard care (4 days [IQR 0-8]; median di/uniFB00erence 2 days, 95% CI 1-3; p<0\u00b70001). The cumulative incidence of hospital stay (comprising any initial hospital stay plus re\u00adadmission days in hospital) is shown in Figure 2. The di/uniFB00erence in overall hospital stay during 30 days was also signif\u00ad icant when calculated in hours (ambulatory median 4\u00b77 h [IQR 2\u00b77-59\u00b72] vs standard care median 74\u00b77 h [IQR 6\u00b73-178\u00b72); p<0\u00b70001; Table 2). In the ambulatory care group, 73 (64%) of 114 patients with available data were discharged on the same day as admission, compared with 39 (34%) of 115 patients with available data in the standard care group (p<0\u00b70001; appendix p 3). In 24 patients (12 in ambulatory care; 12 in standard care), data were missing either at 1\u00adweek or at 30\u00addays follow\u00ad up, or both.\nRe\u00adadmission rates were similar in the ambulatory and standard care groups (Table 2). The time until successful completion of treatment, defined as when the ambulatory device was removed (ambulatory care) or when the patient had a successful outcome from aspiration or chest tube\nremoval after drainage (standard care), was significantly longer in patients in the ambulatory care group (Table 2). The total time o/uniFB00 work did not di/uniFB00er between groups, with a mean of 10\u00b77 days (SD 11\u00b79) in the ambulatory care group and 11\u00b75 days (SD 13\u00b70) in the standard care group.\nThe prespecified subgroups also showed di/uniFB00erences in hospital stay, including for previous history of pneumothorax and smoking history (tobacco and mar\u00ad ijuana; Table 3). The tests for interactions were not significant in any of the subgroup analyses; hence, conclusions cannot be drawn about di/uniFB00erential benefits in the subgroups.\nIn the worst\u00adcase scenario sensitivity analysis, median hospital stay in the first 30 days remained significantly shorter in those who received ambulatory care (1 day [IQR 0-6]) than in those who received standard care (4 days [IQR 0-8]; median di/uniFB00erence 1 day, 95% CI 0-2; p=0\u00b70057).\nBecause not all patients in the standard care arm had aspiration, we did a post\u00adhoc analysis of the primary outcome excluding patients in whom no aspiration was done (ie, who proceeded directly to chest drain insertion as per clinician preference). Removing the 31 (26%) of 119 patients in whom no aspiration was attempted in the standard care arm, the primary outcome still favoured the intervention arm. The median length of stay for patients in the standard care arm in whom aspiration was done was 3 days (IQR 0-8), and the median di/uniFB00erence was 1 (95% CI 0-3; p=0\u00b70001).\nRegarding the secondary outcomes, initial treatment data was available for 227 (96%) of 236 patients. Docu\u00ad mented per\u00adprotocol compliance with allocated treatment was 114 (97%) of 117 patients receiving ambulatory care and 113 (95%) of 119 patients receiving standard care. Among 119 patients receiving standard care, initial management was pleural aspiration in 81 (68%) patients,\n38 (47%) of whom subsequently required chest drain insertion. 31 (26%) of 119 patients receiving standard care were initially managed with a chest drain (Table 4).\nFollowing the initial intervention, patients who received ambulatory care required fewer total pleural procedures (mean 1\u00b72 [SD 0\u00b75]) than did those who received standard care (mean 1\u00b74 [SD 0\u00b77]; p=0\u00b70327), and 40 (33\u00b76%) of 119 patients who received standard care required one or\nData are n (%) unless otherwise indicated. *Data not recorded on database.\nmore further pleural procedures (Table 4). Surgical referral rates were similar in both groups, including 33 (28%) of 117 patients who received ambulatory care and 26 (22%) of 119 patients who had standard care. Of patients referred for surgery, 21 (64%) in ambulatory care and 19 (73%) in standard care then had a surgical procedure.\nMean pain and breathlessness VAS scores were high at baseline and improved with treatment in both treatment groups (Figure 3). Reported pain after the first inter\u00ad vention was similar in both groups and improved during days 1-4. There was no significant di/uniFB00erence in analgesia use between the two groups during days 0-4 (appendix pp 5-6).\nAmong the study population, 1 week after completion of treatment, 26 (12%) of 220 patients had an ongoing pneumothorax (not requiring admission) and 27 (12%) had a recurrence (appendix p 7). The proportion of patients with recurrence at day 7 was lower in the ambulatory care group (8 [7%] of 110 patients) than in the standard care group (19 [19%] of 110 patients; p=0\u00b702). Of 19 patients receiving standard care with recurrence, 10 (53%) were initially treated with aspiration, five (26%) had aspiration then chest tube insertion, and four (21%) had chest tube insertion. A further 19 patients (9%) had a recurrence between day 7 and day 30.\nFollow\u00adup data were available up to 12 months for 181 (77%) of 236 patients, with the remainder lost to follow\u00adup. Recurrence rates from 1-12 months were\nData are n (%). *Patients could have more than one adverse event. \u2020Required admission and chest tube insertion.\nTable 5: Adverse events\nsimilar in the ambulatory and standard care arms (appendix p 7). The overall rate of ipsilateral pneumothorax recurrence up to 12 months was 24% for the ambulatory arm and 28% for the standard care arm (p=0\u00b722; appendix p 8). Recurrence\u00adfree survival curves are shown in the appendix (p 4).\n110 (47%) of 236 patients had adverse events (Table 5), including 64 (55%) of 117 patients in the ambulatory care arm and 46 (39%) of 119 in the standard care arm. 97 (39%) patients had intervention\u00adrelated or treatment\u00ad related adverse events.\nAll 14 serious adverse events occurred in patients who received ambulatory care, and these events were all rated as serious on the basis of the need for re\u00adadmission to hospital (Table 5). Eight (57%) of the 14 serious adverse events were related to the intervention (and some patients had more than one serious adverse event): four (3%) of 117 patients receiving ambulatory care had an enlarging pneumothorax on repeat chest radiography at outpa\u00ad tient review, which required admission and chest tube insertion; for two (2%) patients the device malfunctioned (tube kinked or blocked); one (1%) patient had radio\u00ad graphic evidence of (asymptomatic) pulmonary oedema at review on day 1, but was admitted for observation without overnight stay; one (1%) device was leaking fluid; the device dislodged in one (1%) patient, requiring chest tube placement; and one (1%) patient was admitted for suction. The remaining four serious adverse events were haemo\u00ad pneumothorax (n=3 [3%]) and pleurisy (n=1 [1%]), which were all judged to be unrelated to the intervention. All three patients with unrecognised haemopneumothorax had chest radiographic evidence of significant fluid (in addition to pneumothorax) before the intervention. These three patients either had surgery or CT angiography that did not identify an intervention\u00adassociated source of bleeding.\nThe most frequent non\u00adserious adverse events were pain at the insertion site, haematoma or bleeding, surgical or subcutaneous emphysema, and failure of the drainage device (Table 5).\n\n## iscussion\n\nThis multicentre, open\u00adlabel, randomised controlled tri al compared an ambulatory treatment strategy for primary spontaneous pneumothorax with standard care using evidence\u00adbased guidelines (aspiration, chest drain insertion, or both), using clinically relevant outcomes including the duration of hospital stay during the first 30 days following intervention. The results show the efficacy of the ambulatory strategy, with most patients successfully managed as outpatients. This finding is supported by analysis of the primary outcome by initial hospital and overall stay in both whole days and number of hours.\nAlthough 24 (21%) of 114 patients who had ambulatory care required at least one further procedure, patients in this group required significantly fewer procedures overall\nthan those who received standard care. Patients in the ambulatory group had longer treatment duration (ie, time with ambulatory device in place) than did the standard care group (ie, time with chest drain in place). This di/uniFB00erence is probably due to a number of factors. First, physicians might have been more cautious in managing patients with the ambulatory device and left the device in situ longer to ensure it was not removed too soon. Second, because patients in the ambulatory care group were being managed as outpatients and reviewed every 24 h, there were fewer opportunities to assess whether the pneumothorax had resolved than there were for those with a chest tube, who were treated in hospital and potentially reviewed many times per day.\nSerious adverse events, defined as those needing admission to hospital, occurred exclusively in the ambulatory care arm. Serious adverse events related to treatment included enlargement of pneumothorax despite the ambulatory device being in place and device blockage and kinking, requiring chest tube insertion and hospitalisation. In the ambulatory care group, three patients had unrecognised haemopneumothoraces, which at review were not considered related to the inter\u00ad vention. Although this higher rate of serious adverse events is clearly important, by the nature of its definition it is biased against the ambulatory arm. Insertion of a chest tube (eg, after failed aspiration) and admission to hospital was not a possible serious adverse event in the standard care arm because this constituted normal care. Therefore, any adverse event in a patient already hospitalised, regardless of the primary intervention, requires careful interpretation. Nonetheless, the increased adverse event rate in the ambulatory arm should be accounted for when using an ambulatory pneumothorax strategy.\nNo significant di/uniFB00erences between intervention groups were observed in secondary outcome measures in terms of VAS pain or breathlessness scores, time o/uniFB00 work, and overall recurrence at 30 days. However, the pneumothorax recurrence rate within 7 days of treatment completion was higher in those who received standard care. Recurrence at this early stage is unusual and is often presumed to be due to enlargement of an ongoing pneumothorax. As a result, investigators classified patients with pneumothorax within 7 days into two categories: ongoing if there had been incomplete re\u00adexpansion on chest radiograph at completion of treatment, or new recurrence if the pneumothorax had fully resolved on the last chest radiograph. The excess recurrence in patients receiving standard care was not entirely due to patients treated with aspiration alone, because they accounted for less than 53% of those with early recurrence.\nLonger\u00adterm recurrence rates (1-12 months) were similar between the two groups. Despite excess recurrence in the standard care arm by 30 days, the cumulative rate of first ipsilateral recurrence was not statistically di/uniFB00erent at 12 months. The overall rate of recurrence (27%) is consistent with previous large epidemiological studies. 1,12\nA 2020 randomised trial 3 in primary spontaneous pneumothorax compared conservative management (ie, no intervention) with standard care (ie, chest tube insertion), 3 reporting that the conservative approach was non\u00adinferior to standard care in the primary outcome of resolution of pneumothorax on chest radiograph at 8 weeks. We have concerns about the widespread adoption of this approach. First, the trial screened more than 2600 patients to ran\u00ad domly assign 316, and it required 39 sites recruiting for 6 years. Excluding patients with previous pneumothorax would automatically exclude about 25% of the population. The reasons for which all other patients were excluded in the trial are unclear. The trial might therefore be applicable only to those patients with minimal symptoms, and it is already recognised that conservative management is whol\u00ad ly appropriate in some cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (as stated in the 2010 BTS guidelines 4 ). Second, the primary outcome was radiological, rather than patient\u00adcentred (eg, symptoms, time in hospital). Few data are presented on patient symptoms except at 2 weeks and what was termed an overall satisfaction score. Therefore, although the conservative treatment study should be applauded for showing reduced inpatient hospital stay, we would suggest that symptomatic patients who choose or are chosen by the treating physicians for intervention should be considered for the ambulatory treatment strategy, which is shown here to be e/uniFB00ective and reasonably safe.\nThere are limitations to this study. Some eligible patients were not enrolled because they presented out of the 0900-1700 National Health Service working hours or when no trained members of sta/uniFB00 were available. This factor introduces a potential recruitment bias, be cause patients presenting out of hours could be more unwell, and thus ambulatory management should be used cautiously in those patients. However, this prospective trial was pragmatic in its design and the patients who enrolled were likely to represent those suitable for ambulatory management. The study was necessarily open label with both patients and physicians aware of treatment allocation; however, the use of objective and identical discharge criteria were used for the primary outcome measure to ensure balance between treatment groups. Finally, not all patients in the standard care arm had pleural aspiration as initial management, which could have introduced bias to\u00ad wards the ambulatory arm. However, a post\u00adhoc analysis excluding these patients showed that the primary outcome remained significantly di/uniFB00erent between the two arms.\nConsidering the data in the present study, what is now the optimal treatment for patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax who require treatment? To our knowledge, our results show for the first time evidence of e/uniFB00ective use of an entirely ambulatory strategy in patients with symptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax, as compared with current evidence based standard care. The ambulatory strategy was associated with reduced hospital stay and did not result in higher surgical or recurrence rates, but it did show an increase in\nadverse events related to readmission. Despite these readmissions, the total number of pleural procedures required and median hospital stay were significantly lower in patients in the ambulatory arm. These results have important implications for practice and suggest that future guidelines should include an ambulatory treatment option. We argue that this study provides strong evidence that the ambulatory strategy should replace the initial treatment (both aspiration and chest tube insertion) that forms the basis of current management guidelines. The ambulatory device used in this trial was the Pleural Vent (Rocket Medical). Ambulatory treatment might be just as e/uniFB00ective with any ambulatory treatment strategy (eg, a chest drain attached to a one\u00adway valve), but other devices were not tested in this study. It should be noted, however, that an ambulatory treatment strategy for primary spontaneous pneumothorax will require health\u00adcare services to develop ambulatory care facilities to allow patients to be safely followed up with the device in situ.\nIn conclusion, in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax, ambulatory management significantly reduces the duration of hospital stay during 30 days. Outpatient management is now a reasonable and prob ably preferable option in the management of this condition.\n\n## ontributors\n\nThe study design was conceived by RJH and NMR.

      "content": "Background Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in otherwise healthy young patients. Optimal management is not defined and often results in prolonged hospitalisation. Data on efficacy of ambulatory options are poor. We aimed to describe the duration of hospitalisation and safety of ambulatory management compared with standard care.\nMethods In this open-label, randomised controlled trial, adults (aged 16-55 years) with symptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax were recruited from 24 UK hospitals during a period of 3 years. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with either an ambulatory device or standard guideline-based management (aspiration, standard chest tube insertion, or both). The primary outcome was total length of hospital stay including re-admission up to 30 days after randomisation. Patients with available data were included in the primary analysis and all assigned patients were included in the safety analysis. The trial was prospectively registered with the International Standard Randomised Clinical Trials Number, ISRCTN79151659.\nFindings Of 776 patients screened between July, 2015, and March, 2019, 236 (30%) were randomly assigned to ambulatory care (n=117) and standard care (n=119). At day 30, the median hospitalisation was significantly shorter in the 114 patients with available data who received ambulatory treatment (0 days [IQR 0-3]) than in the 113 with available data who received standard care (4 days [IQR 0-8]; p<0\u00b70001; median di/uniFB00erence 2 days [95% CI 1-3]). 110 (47%) of 236 patients had adverse events, including 64 (55%) of 117 patients in the ambulatory care arm and 46 (39%) of 119 in the standard care arm. All 14 serious adverse events occurred in patients who received ambulatory care, eight (57%) of which were related to the intervention, including an enlarging pneumothorax, asymptomatic pulmonary oedema, and the device malfunctioning, leaking, or dislodging.\nInterpretation Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax significantly reduced the duration of hospitalisation including re-admissions in the first 30 days, but at the expense of increased adverse events. This data suggests that primary spontaneous pneumothorax can be managed for outpatients, using ambulatory devices in those who require intervention.\nFunding UK National Institute for Health Research.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

      "content": "Pneumothorax is a common clinical problem. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax describes patients develop\u00ad ing pneumothorax in the absence of trauma, with no underlying established lung pathology, and occurs in in approximately 3000 patients per year in the UK. 1,2 Some patients can be managed conservatively with close obser\u00ad vation, 3,4 but many symptomatic patients require an inter\u00ad vention to re\u00adexpand the lung. Current British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines suggest that aspiration of trapped air using a cannula and syringe should be considered, but more than 50% of patients subsequently require the inser\u00ad tion of a chest tube, which is then attached to an underwater seal drainage system. 4 The mean duration of hospitalisation of patients admitted for drainage is 6-8 days. 5\nAmbulatory management of patients with primary spon\u00ad taneous pneumothorax potentially removes the need for\nlong hospital admission by facilitating outpatient treatment. Reducing the need for chest tubes with bulky underwater systems might allow patients to remain mobile and facilitate early discharge with the device in situ. Ambulatory devices generally incorporate a Heimlich (one\u00adway) valve, which replaces the traditional underwater seal, either by in\u00ad line attachment to a standard chest tube or as part of an integrated device. However, the efficacy and safety of this approach has yet to be rigorously assessed. A systematic review 6 of the literature found that 18 studies describing ambulatory management of both spontaneous and iat\u00ad rogenic pneumothorax reported an overall success rate of 86% and successful outpatient management in 78% of cases, with few complications. Unfortunately, the available evidence was described as poor quality with a high risk of bias, including two inadequately powered random\u00ad ised trials and several retrospective case series. 6\nLancet 2020; 396: 39-49\nSee Comment page 4 Oxford Centre for Respiratory Medicine (R J Hallifax PhD) and Oxford Respiratory Trials Unit (M Laskawiec-Szkonter MA, Prof N M Rahman PhD) , University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Royal Berkshire National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, Reading, UK (E McKeown MRCP) ; Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK (P Sivakumar MRCP, A West MRCP) ; Queen Margaret Hospital, NHS Fife, Dunfermline, UK (I Fairbairn MRCP) ; Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust, Bath, UK (C Peter MRCP) ; Western General Hospital, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK (A Leitch PhD) ; West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Watford, UK (M Knight MRCP) ; Great Western Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Swindon, UK (A Stanton MRCP) ; University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, Lancaster, UK (A Ijaz MBBS) ; Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK (Prof S Marciniak PhD) ; North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK (J Cameron FRCEM, J E Harvey MD) ; Blackpool Fylde and Wyre Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Blackpool, UK (A Bhatta FRCP) ; Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, UK (K G Blyth MD) ; Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK (K G Blyth) ; Kettering General Hospital, Kettering, UK (R Reddy FRCP) ; Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK (M-C Harris FCEM) ; University Hospitals of North Midlands, Stoke-on-Trent, UK (N Maddekar MRCP) ; Academic Respiratory Unit, University of\nBristol, Bristol, UK\nThe Randomised Ambulatory Management of Primary Pneumothorax (RAMPP) trial was done to determine whether ambulatory management of patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax is safe and reduces the length of hospitalisation.",

Patients were ineligible if they had known or suspected underlying lung disease (including >20 pack\u00adyear tobacco smoking history, but excluding well controlled asthma), evidence of tension pneumothorax (defined as clinical or radiographic evidence of significantly increased intra\u00ad pleural pressure causing haemodynamic compromise that requires urgent decompression), or a contraindication\nto thoracic procedure as determined by the responsible physician, or if they were pregnant or lactating.

      "content": "This trial challenges the current guidelines for management for patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax, with the proviso that some patients will require further treatment.\nSee Online for appendix\ncoordinator or local Principal Investigator. Following device insertion, patients were observed for 1-2 h to assess them for clinical stability, after which a chest radiograph was done (appendix p 44).\nIf the chest radiograph showed insufficient lung re\u00ad expansion, the ambulatory device remained in situ and the patient was discharged, as long as the prespecified criteria of fitness for discharge were fulfilled. These criteria consisted of all of the following: the patient agreed, had clinically stable cardiorespiratory observations, had no increase in the size of pneumothorax since the last radiograph or review, did not require oxygen or other respiratory support, was mobile and able to self\u00adcare, was provided with written information on point of contact and follow\u00adup plan, and lives with a responsible person at home. Any patient not meeting these criteria remained hospitalised and was reviewed daily. Sufficient lung re\u00ad expansion was defined as complete or almost complete re\u00adexpansion (<1 cm rim of air apically on chest radiograph) and being unable to aspirate air through the device using a connector and syringe.\nIf discharged home with the device in situ, patients were reviewed as an outpatient every 1-2 days (generally daily, but a single review during the weekend was sufficient if clinically stable) until day 4, at which stage the patient should be considered for thoracic surgery. The timing of the ongoing outpatient review after day 4 was at the discretion of the responsible clinician. After each review, if there was sufficient re\u00adexpansion of the lung and no ongoing air leak, the device was removed and the patient was discharged. A postremoval chest radiograph was done to ensure that the lung had not recollapsed. If the chest radiograph showed recurrence of pneumothorax, the patient was rehospitalised for observation and consideration of the placement of a standard chest tube connected to an underwater seal.\nPatients who were in the control arm received standard treatment as per the 2010 BTS Pleural Guidelines. 4 In brief, pleural aspiration (if the clinician deemed it appropriate) was attempted under local anaesthetic using a 14-16 gauge cannula and syringe, aspirating a maximum of 2\u00b75 L. The patient was observed for 1-2 h to assess for clinical stability, and a repeat chest radiograph was done. If the repeat chest radiograph showed sufficient lung re\u00ad expansion, the patient was discharged. If the lung had not sufficiently re\u00adexpanded, then a small\u00adbore chest tube (\u226414 F) was inserted and attached to an underwater seal, and the patient was admitted to hospital.\nAlthough initial aspiration was recommended in the trial protocol, the responsible clinician was able to proceed directly to chest tube insertion and admission at their discretion, in line with BTS guidelines. 4 Decisions regarding chest tube removal were as per standard practice at participating centres but included no further air leak (as shown by a non\u00adbubbling chest tube) and full lung expansion on chest radiograph. A postremoval chest radiograph was done to ensure that the lung had not\nrecollapsed. Fitness for discharge criteria were assessed daily to provide equality between treatment groups. Evidence for the use of suction in patients with pneu\u00ad mothorax is poor. BTS guidelines suggest that high volume, low pressure suction should not be routinely used but could be considered if there is prolonged air leak. 4 Use of suction was at the discretion of the local responsible clinician.\nPatients were followed up at 1 week after the completion of treatment, and 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after randomisation. Hospital admissions and pneumothorax recurrence were measured up to the day 30 follow\u00adup point, and at each follow\u00adup point, data were collected on further hospital admissions, pain and breathlessness visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, quality of life, and smoking status. Patients who were not able to attend face\u00adto\u00adface follow\u00adup appointments were contacted by telephone to check for complications or recurrence, and if this was not possible, data on recurrence was collected through hospital or general practitioner medical records. Data on pneumothorax recurrence at 6 and 12 months will be presented separately with data from the obser\u00ad vational cohort.",

      "title": "Outcomes",
      "content": "The primary outcome was the total length of hospital stay up to 30 days after randomisation, including initial hospital stay and re\u00adadmissions. Patients remaining in hospital overnight were recorded as having a 1\u00adday stay; those discharged on the same day (either after successful needle aspiration treatment or discharge with the ambulatory device) were recorded as zero length of stay. The 30\u00adday point was chosen on the basis of previous data suggesting that most conservatively treated (non\u00ad surgical) primary spontaneous pneumothorax air leaks resolve within 14 days of initial treatment, 8 and thus outcomes measured at 30 days were considered reliably to capture all related re\u00adadmissions. Patients with missing data at 1 week after treatment or 30 days after randomisation were assumed to have no re\u00adadmissions. Re\u00adadmission was defined as the need for emergency (non\u00adplanned) admission to hospital for any reason in relation to pneumothorax but was not restricted to the requirement for a further pleural intervention. Any re\u00ad admission to hospital was recorded as at least a 1\u00adday stay. Planned day case reviews for outpatient treated patients were not included.\nSecondary outcomes included the need for a further pleural procedure, adverse events, pain and breath\u00ad lessness VAS scores, recurrence rates, and time o/uniFB00 work because of pneumothorax treatment. Further pleural procedures were defined as any intervention that punctured the pleura (eg, chest drain insertion) after a first treatment intervention. We obtained a daily record of thoracic pain and breathlessness scores using a VAS score up to day 4 after randomisation, which was measured on a scale of 0 to 100 mm. A score of 0 indicated\nthe complete absence of symptoms and 100 was the maximum possible level of symptoms, which is validated for assessment of breathlessness in patients having pleural procedures. 9,10 VAS scores were also recorded on completion of treatment. Because patients could be discharged with a small residual pneumothorax, those with a persistent small pneumothorax at 1\u00adweek follow\u00ad up were defined as having ongoing pneumotho rax rather than a new occurrence. The recurrence of pneumotho\u00ad rax was defined as a new episode of symptomatic pneumothorax after full resolution on chest radiograph, or occurring after the 1\u00adweek follow\u00adup visit. Several other secondary outcomes including quality of life questionnaires (EuroQol\u00ad5D\u00ad5L), blood parameters, and digital air flow analysis are planned for separate publications.\nConcerning the failure of medical treatment, there is no robust evidence on the optimal timing for surgical intervention in primary spontaneous pneumothorax after initial treatment in the presence of ongoing air leak. Current BTS guidelines suggest that cases of persistent air leak or non\u00adre\u00adexpansion should be referred for surgery after 3-5 days. 4 To achieve objective outcomes for this study, the following criteria were developed to ensure\nconsistent practice in both groups, and were recorded in all cases. Referral for thoracic surgery occurred in the presence of all of the following: (1) persistent air leak on day 4 after insertion of chest tube (as measured by bubbling chest tube attached to an underwater seal) or evidence of ongoing air leak through the ambulatory device; (2) persis\u00ad tent pneumothorax on chest radiograph; (3) patient agreed to have surgery; and (4) no contraindication to thoracic surgery.\nSafety data were collected for all patients at each trial visit regarding adverse events, with seriousness defined as per Good Clinical Practice guidelines. 11 Expected adverse events were pain at the drainage site, minor haemorrhage not requiring specific intervention (eg, blood transfusion or surgery), subcutaneous emphysema, pleural infection, unintentional removal (falling out) of the Pleural Vent or chest tube, recurrence of pneumothorax or worsening of ongoing pneumothorax (if evidence of failure of full resolution following initial intervention), re\u00adexpansion pulmonary oedema, and the need for further (non\u00ad emergency) pleural procedures. Expected serious adverse events included tension pneumothorax occurring during treatment, blockage of chest tube with clinical con\u00ad sequences (eg, patient unwell or further procedure required), major intrathoracic haemorrhage requiring specific intervention (eg, blood transfusion), and any additional emergency pleural procedure as deemed necessary by the local investigator (eg, large bore chest tube insertion). Because the recurrence of pneumothorax is common and expected (occurring in about 33% of primary spontaneous pneumothorax cases within 1 year 1,12 ), recurrence was not reported as a serious adverse event.

The sample size for the primary outcome was determined to detect a di/uniFB00erence in length of hospital stay of 2\u00b73 days: from a mean of 4 days admission in patients receiving standard care to an expected mean of 1\u00b77 days in patients receiving ambulatory care (standard deviation in both groups 6\u00b70). The sample size calculation included a correction factor for non\u00adnormal data. These estimates assume that up to 50% of patients receiving standard care were expected to be successfully treated with aspiration alone (ie, zero\u00adday admission). It was assumed, conser\u00ad vatively, that about 20% of patients in the ambulatory care arm would require re\u00adadmission. Based on these param\u00ad eters, with 80% power, a 5% two\u00adsided significance level, and a 10% attrition rate, the study required 236 patients.

Survival analysis techniques were used to compare time to discharge between the two groups using the Gehan\u00adBreslow\u00adWilcoxon test (more appropriate than the log\u00adrank test because of a high early event rate in primary spontaneous pneumothorax) and using Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate a hazard ratio and associated 95% confidence interval.

The Student's t test was used to compare mean di/uniFB00erences in length of stay.\nA worst\u00adcase scenario sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome was done by assigning the longest possible initial hospital day to those patients who were missing follow\u00adup forms in the ambulatory care arm.\nContinuous secondary outcome measures were analysed using ANCOVA adjusting for baseline scores.

      "content": "We recruited patients between August 27, 2015, and March 12, 2019. After approaching 776 potentially eligible patients, we reached our target of 236 (30%) participants, of whom 117 were assigned to ambulatory care and 119 to\nstandard care (Figure 1). The mean age at recruitment was 30 years (SD 8). 193 (82%) patients were male, 58 (25%) had a history of previous pneumothorax, and 20 (8%) had a family history (first\u00addegree or second\u00addegree relative) of pneumothorax (Table 1). 161 (68%) patients were current or former tobacco smokers, with a median pack\u00adyear history for both groups combined of 8 (IQR 5-12), and 114 (48%) were current or former marijuana smokers (Table 1). Most patients were symp tomatic with either chest pain (213 [90%]) or shortness of breath (210 [89%]).\nFor the primary outcome, we analysed 114 (97%) of 117 patients who received ambulatory care and 113 (95%) of 119 who received standard care, because data was not available for the remaining patients. Among those who had ambulatory care, the median hospital stay in the first 30 days was 0 days [IQR 0-3], which was significantly lower than in those who received standard care (4 days [IQR 0-8]; median di/uniFB00erence 2 days, 95% CI 1-3; p<0\u00b70001). The cumulative incidence of hospital stay (comprising any initial hospital stay plus re\u00adadmission days in hospital) is shown in Figure 2. The di/uniFB00erence in overall hospital stay during 30 days was also signif\u00ad icant when calculated in hours (ambulatory median 4\u00b77 h [IQR 2\u00b77-59\u00b72] vs standard care median 74\u00b77 h [IQR 6\u00b73-178\u00b72); p<0\u00b70001; Table 2). In the ambulatory care group, 73 (64%) of 114 patients with available data were discharged on the same day as admission, compared with 39 (34%) of 115 patients with available data in the standard care group (p<0\u00b70001; appendix p 3). In 24 patients (12 in ambulatory care; 12 in standard care), data were missing either at 1\u00adweek or at 30\u00addays follow\u00ad up, or both.\nRe\u00adadmission rates were similar in the ambulatory and standard care groups (Table 2). The time until successful completion of treatment, defined as when the ambulatory device was removed (ambulatory care) or when the patient had a successful outcome from aspiration or chest tube\nremoval after drainage (standard care), was significantly longer in patients in the ambulatory care group (Table 2). The total time o/uniFB00 work did not di/uniFB00er between groups, with a mean of 10\u00b77 days (SD 11\u00b79) in the ambulatory care group and 11\u00b75 days (SD 13\u00b70) in the standard care group.\nThe prespecified subgroups also showed di/uniFB00erences in hospital stay, including for previous history of pneumothorax and smoking history (tobacco and mar\u00ad ijuana; Table 3). The tests for interactions were not significant in any of the subgroup analyses; hence, conclusions cannot be drawn about di/uniFB00erential benefits in the subgroups.\nIn the worst\u00adcase scenario sensitivity analysis, median hospital stay in the first 30 days remained significantly shorter in those who received ambulatory care (1 day [IQR 0-6]) than in those who received standard care (4 days [IQR 0-8]; median di/uniFB00erence 1 day, 95% CI 0-2; p=0\u00b70057).\nBecause not all patients in the standard care arm had aspiration, we did a post\u00adhoc analysis of the primary outcome excluding patients in whom no aspiration was done (ie, who proceeded directly to chest drain insertion as per clinician preference). Removing the 31 (26%) of 119 patients in whom no aspiration was attempted in the standard care arm, the primary outcome still favoured the intervention arm. The median length of stay for patients in the standard care arm in whom aspiration was done was 3 days (IQR 0-8), and the median di/uniFB00erence was 1 (95% CI 0-3; p=0\u00b70001).\nRegarding the secondary outcomes, initial treatment data was available for 227 (96%) of 236 patients. Docu\u00ad mented per\u00adprotocol compliance with allocated treatment was 114 (97%) of 117 patients receiving ambulatory care and 113 (95%) of 119 patients receiving standard care. Among 119 patients receiving standard care, initial management was pleural aspiration in 81 (68%) patients,\n38 (47%) of whom subsequently required chest drain insertion. 31 (26%) of 119 patients receiving standard care were initially managed with a chest drain (Table 4).\nFollowing the initial intervention, patients who received ambulatory care required fewer total pleural procedures (mean 1\u00b72 [SD 0\u00b75]) than did those who received standard care (mean 1\u00b74 [SD 0\u00b77]; p=0\u00b70327), and 40 (33\u00b76%) of 119 patients who received standard care required one or\nData are n (%) unless otherwise indicated. *Data not recorded on database.\nmore further pleural procedures (Table 4). Surgical referral rates were similar in both groups, including 33 (28%) of 117 patients who received ambulatory care and 26 (22%) of 119 patients who had standard care. Of patients referred for surgery, 21 (64%) in ambulatory care and 19 (73%) in standard care then had a surgical procedure.\nMean pain and breathlessness VAS scores were high at baseline and improved with treatment in both treatment groups (Figure 3). Reported pain after the first inter\u00ad vention was similar in both groups and improved during days 1-4. There was no significant di/uniFB00erence in analgesia use between the two groups during days 0-4 (appendix pp 5-6).\nAmong the study population, 1 week after completion of treatment, 26 (12%) of 220 patients had an ongoing pneumothorax (not requiring admission) and 27 (12%) had a recurrence (appendix p 7). The proportion of patients with recurrence at day 7 was lower in the ambulatory care group (8 [7%] of 110 patients) than in the standard care group (19 [19%] of 110 patients; p=0\u00b702). Of 19 patients receiving standard care with recurrence, 10 (53%) were initially treated with aspiration, five (26%) had aspiration then chest tube insertion, and four (21%) had chest tube insertion. A further 19 patients (9%) had a recurrence between day 7 and day 30.\nFollow\u00adup data were available up to 12 months for 181 (77%) of 236 patients, with the remainder lost to follow\u00adup. Recurrence rates from 1-12 months were\nData are n (%). *Patients could have more than one adverse event. \u2020Required admission and chest tube insertion.\nTable 5: Adverse events\nsimilar in the ambulatory and standard care arms (appendix p 7). The overall rate of ipsilateral pneumothorax recurrence up to 12 months was 24% for the ambulatory arm and 28% for the standard care arm (p=0\u00b722; appendix p 8). Recurrence\u00adfree survival curves are shown in the appendix (p 4).\n110 (47%) of 236 patients had adverse events (Table 5), including 64 (55%) of 117 patients in the ambulatory care arm and 46 (39%) of 119 in the standard care arm. 97 (39%) patients had intervention\u00adrelated or treatment\u00ad related adverse events.\nAll 14 serious adverse events occurred in patients who received ambulatory care, and these events were all rated as serious on the basis of the need for re\u00adadmission to hospital (Table 5). Eight (57%) of the 14 serious adverse events were related to the intervention (and some patients had more than one serious adverse event): four (3%) of 117 patients receiving ambulatory care had an enlarging pneumothorax on repeat chest radiography at outpa\u00ad tient review, which required admission and chest tube insertion; for two (2%) patients the device malfunctioned (tube kinked or blocked); one (1%) patient had radio\u00ad graphic evidence of (asymptomatic) pulmonary oedema at review on day 1, but was admitted for observation without overnight stay; one (1%) device was leaking fluid; the device dislodged in one (1%) patient, requiring chest tube placement; and one (1%) patient was admitted for suction. The remaining four serious adverse events were haemo\u00ad pneumothorax (n=3 [3%]) and pleurisy (n=1 [1%]), which were all judged to be unrelated to the intervention. All three patients with unrecognised haemopneumothorax had chest radiographic evidence of significant fluid (in addition to pneumothorax) before the intervention. These three patients either had surgery or CT angiography that did not identify an intervention\u00adassociated source of bleeding.\nThe most frequent non\u00adserious adverse events were pain at the insertion site, haematoma or bleeding, surgical or subcutaneous emphysema, and failure of the drainage device (Table 5).",

      "content": "This multicentre, open\u00adlabel, randomised controlled tri al compared an ambulatory treatment strategy for primary spontaneous pneumothorax with standard care using evidence\u00adbased guidelines (aspiration, chest drain insertion, or both), using clinically relevant outcomes including the duration of hospital stay during the first 30 days following intervention. The results show the efficacy of the ambulatory strategy, with most patients successfully managed as outpatients. This finding is supported by analysis of the primary outcome by initial hospital and overall stay in both whole days and number of hours.\nAlthough 24 (21%) of 114 patients who had ambulatory care required at least one further procedure, patients in this group required significantly fewer procedures overall\nthan those who received standard care. Patients in the ambulatory group had longer treatment duration (ie, time with ambulatory device in place) than did the standard care group (ie, time with chest drain in place). This di/uniFB00erence is probably due to a number of factors. First, physicians might have been more cautious in managing patients with the ambulatory device and left the device in situ longer to ensure it was not removed too soon. Second, because patients in the ambulatory care group were being managed as outpatients and reviewed every 24 h, there were fewer opportunities to assess whether the pneumothorax had resolved than there were for those with a chest tube, who were treated in hospital and potentially reviewed many times per day.\nSerious adverse events, defined as those needing admission to hospital, occurred exclusively in the ambulatory care arm. Serious adverse events related to treatment included enlargement of pneumothorax despite the ambulatory device being in place and device blockage and kinking, requiring chest tube insertion and hospitalisation. In the ambulatory care group, three patients had unrecognised haemopneumothoraces, which at review were not considered related to the inter\u00ad vention. Although this higher rate of serious adverse events is clearly important, by the nature of its definition it is biased against the ambulatory arm. Insertion of a chest tube (eg, after failed aspiration) and admission to hospital was not a possible serious adverse event in the standard care arm because this constituted normal care. Therefore, any adverse event in a patient already hospitalised, regardless of the primary intervention, requires careful interpretation. Nonetheless, the increased adverse event rate in the ambulatory arm should be accounted for when using an ambulatory pneumothorax strategy.\nNo significant di/uniFB00erences between intervention groups were observed in secondary outcome measures in terms of VAS pain or breathlessness scores, time o/uniFB00 work, and overall recurrence at 30 days. However, the pneumothorax recurrence rate within 7 days of treatment completion was higher in those who received standard care. Recurrence at this early stage is unusual and is often presumed to be due to enlargement of an ongoing pneumothorax. As a result, investigators classified patients with pneumothorax within 7 days into two categories: ongoing if there had been incomplete re\u00adexpansion on chest radiograph at completion of treatment, or new recurrence if the pneumothorax had fully resolved on the last chest radiograph. The excess recurrence in patients receiving standard care was not entirely due to patients treated with aspiration alone, because they accounted for less than 53% of those with early recurrence.\nLonger\u00adterm recurrence rates (1-12 months) were similar between the two groups. Despite excess recurrence in the standard care arm by 30 days, the cumulative rate of first ipsilateral recurrence was not statistically di/uniFB00erent at 12 months. The overall rate of recurrence (27%) is consistent with previous large epidemiological studies. 1,12\nA 2020 randomised trial 3 in primary spontaneous pneumothorax compared conservative management (ie, no intervention) with standard care (ie, chest tube insertion), 3 reporting that the conservative approach was non\u00adinferior to standard care in the primary outcome of resolution of pneumothorax on chest radiograph at 8 weeks. We have concerns about the widespread adoption of this approach. First, the trial screened more than 2600 patients to ran\u00ad domly assign 316, and it required 39 sites recruiting for 6 years. Excluding patients with previous pneumothorax would automatically exclude about 25% of the population. The reasons for which all other patients were excluded in the trial are unclear. The trial might therefore be applicable only to those patients with minimal symptoms, and it is already recognised that conservative management is whol\u00ad ly appropriate in some cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (as stated in the 2010 BTS guidelines 4 ). Second, the primary outcome was radiological, rather than patient\u00adcentred (eg, symptoms, time in hospital). Few data are presented on patient symptoms except at 2 weeks and what was termed an overall satisfaction score. Therefore, although the conservative treatment study should be applauded for showing reduced inpatient hospital stay, we would suggest that symptomatic patients who choose or are chosen by the treating physicians for intervention should be considered for the ambulatory treatment strategy, which is shown here to be e/uniFB00ective and reasonably safe.\nThere are limitations to this study. Some eligible patients were not enrolled because they presented out of the 0900-1700 National Health Service working hours or when no trained members of sta/uniFB00 were available. This factor introduces a potential recruitment bias, be cause patients presenting out of hours could be more unwell, and thus ambulatory management should be used cautiously in those patients. However, this prospective trial was pragmatic in its design and the patients who enrolled were likely to represent those suitable for ambulatory management. The study was necessarily open label with both patients and physicians aware of treatment allocation; however, the use of objective and identical discharge criteria were used for the primary outcome measure to ensure balance between treatment groups. Finally, not all patients in the standard care arm had pleural aspiration as initial management, which could have introduced bias to\u00ad wards the ambulatory arm. However, a post\u00adhoc analysis excluding these patients showed that the primary outcome remained significantly di/uniFB00erent between the two arms.\nConsidering the data in the present study, what is now the optimal treatment for patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax who require treatment? To our knowledge, our results show for the first time evidence of e/uniFB00ective use of an entirely ambulatory strategy in patients with symptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax, as compared with current evidence based standard care. The ambulatory strategy was associated with reduced hospital stay and did not result in higher surgical or recurrence rates, but it did show an increase in\nadverse events related to readmission. Despite these readmissions, the total number of pleural procedures required and median hospital stay were significantly lower in patients in the ambulatory arm. These results have important implications for practice and suggest that future guidelines should include an ambulatory treatment option. We argue that this study provides strong evidence that the ambulatory strategy should replace the initial treatment (both aspiration and chest tube insertion) that forms the basis of current management guidelines. The ambulatory device used in this trial was the Pleural Vent (Rocket Medical). Ambulatory treatment might be just as e/uniFB00ective with any ambulatory treatment strategy (eg, a chest drain attached to a one\u00adway valve), but other devices were not tested in this study. It should be noted, however, that an ambulatory treatment strategy for primary spontaneous pneumothorax will require health\u00adcare services to develop ambulatory care facilities to allow patients to be safely followed up with the device in situ.\nIn conclusion, in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax, ambulatory management significantly reduces the duration of hospital stay during 30 days. Outpatient management is now a reasonable and prob ably preferable option in the management of this condition.",
