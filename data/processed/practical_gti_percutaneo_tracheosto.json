ST is usually performed in the operating room under general anesthesia and entails surgical dissection of the neck tissue to create a stoma. Conversely, in PDT, a needle is placed percutaneously and then, using a modified Seldinger technique, a stoma is created by dilation. PDT has a smaller incision size, shorter procedural duration, less postoperative bleeding, and faster healing time compared to ST.4 Several meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ST and PDT have also confirmed that PDT is associated with significantly shorter operative time, lower cost, lower incidence of perioperative bleeding, shorter sedation time, accelerated wound healing, and lower risk of stoma infections. However, there is no difference in mortality between ST and PDT.5–9 In this chapter, we will primarily focus on PDT in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. SURGICAL TRACHEOSTOMY TECHNIQUE\nST is ideally performed in the operating room under general anesthesia, although ST may be performed at the bedside. Landmarks should be identified preoperatively, including the thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, and sternal notch. Local anesthetic with 1 % lidocaine with epinephrine is infiltrated at the incision site if not performing under general anesthesia. A 2–3-cm long transverse skin incision is made about a centimeter below the cricoid cartilage. The midline raphe is located, and retractors are used on either side of the strap muscles to expose the trachea. The endotracheal tube (ETT) is slightly withdrawn to allow stoma creation. An incision is made in the interspaces between the first and the second tracheal rings and is extended laterally. Stay sutures are placed through the skin, around the tracheal ring, and then back through the skin.10 Often a Bjork flap is made. The tracheostomy tube (TT) is then placed through the tracheostomy stoma, the cuff inflated, and the ventilator circuit connected. The TT is secured with sutures in the neck and ventilation is then transferred from the ETT to TT. TYPES OF PERCUTANEOUS DILATIONAL TRACHEOSTOMY\nThe first tracheostomy technique described in 1955 required a special needle to enter the trachea and involved a one-stage insertion of the TT using a cutting trocar.11\ntube (ETT) is slightly withdrawn to allow stoma creation.

TIMING OF TRACHEOSTOMY\nIn general the consensus for appropriate time to perform tracheostomy is around 10–20 days after intubation. Early tracheostomy (within 7 days after intubation) in critically ill patients is associated with a reduction in weaning time, complications, and morbidity and mortality.29–31 Early tracheostomy, performed within 4–7 days of admission, is associated with a significant increase in ventilator-free days (VFD).32 A systematic review of RCTs comparing outcomes of early versus late tracheostomy confirmed more VFD, shorter ICU stays, a shorter duration of sedation, and reduced long-term mortality in patients with early tracheostomy.33 However, although early tracheostomy reduced hospital length of stay and cost, it did not affect in-hospital mortality.34 TRACHEOSTOMY TUBES AND TYPES\nThe main components of the TT are an outer cannula, the flange, and an inner cannula ( The curved outer cannula ( The flange is attached to the proximal end or is a part of the TT, which is used to secure the TT on the neck with a tracheostomy tie or suture. The flange is commonly labeled with the tube size, type, and length. The inner cannula ( The obturator ( Patients on a ventilator or those with risk of aspiration usually require a cuffed TT.

The cuff is connected to a pilot balloon ( DSECTION Additional IP Topics The TTs come in different sizes and shapes depending on the length, curvature, thickness, and a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this chapter. A modified TT is available for placement with the PDT technique ( A longer TT is used in obese patients to accommodate the longer skin to tracheal distance so the distal tip of the TT ( PERCUTANEOUS TRACHEOSTOMY KIT The two well-known commercially available kits in the United States that use a single-stage dilator include the Ciaglia Blue Rhino (Cook Medical Inc, Bloomington, IN, USA) and Portex Ultraperc (Smiths Medical, Dublin, OH, USA). BRONCHOSCOPY Bronchoscopic guidance is an important adjunct in proper placement of TTs during PDT to avoid posterior wall trauma or puncture, and is especially important in patients with obesity, difficult anatomy, or those with cervical fixation or an unstable cervical spine. A more detailed procedural description is provided later, including how bronchoscopy can be utilized to confirm placement of the guidewire, and to avoid false lumen formation and tracheal injury. There is conflicting evidence, with some studies failing to demonstrate a benefit for concurrent bronchoscopy, whereas others have found that bronchoscopic visualization during PDT reduces complications. For example, a retrospective analysis of PDT with and without bronchoscopy in the trauma population revealed no significant difference in safety and efficacy with experienced operators.35 However, over time other studies have shown the benefits of routinely utilizing bronchoscopy when performing PDT. For example, a prospective study reported significantly lower rates of major complications including bleeding, subcutaneous emphysema, or pneumothorax (20 % vs. 40 %); higher rate of first-time successful needle puncture; and significantly shorter procedural duration with bronchoscopic guidance.36 On balance, given that false lumens and unrecognized tracheal lacerations are the most significant major complications of PDT, concurrent bronchoscopy during PDT should be considered an essential element of PDT in terms of safety. At present, bronchoscopic guidance is used routinely by almost all interventional pulmonologists. ULTRASOUND GUIDANCE DURING PERCUTANEOUS DILATIONAL TRACHEOSTOMY Ultrasound guidance during PDT can assist with localizing anatomic landmarks and to identify the appropriate point of entry by examining the pretracheal area for aberrant vasculature, tracheal rings, neck mass, and the thyroid gland.

Real-time ultrasound can be used to A\nBCHAPTER Percutaneous Tracheostomy follow the needle path during tracheal puncture and to determine the final position of the TT.37, However, injury to the posterior tracheal wall cannot be assessed with ultrasound due to the inability to visualize the posterior wall.39 In our practice, we do not routinely use ultrasound guidance. A randomized prospective study comparing efficacy, safety, and incidence of complications between bronchoscopic guidance and ultrasound guidance revealed no significant differences between the two groups in terms of technical difficulty of the procedure or the number of needle interventions. Interestingly, the risk of hemorrhage was higher and the mean duration of procedure was longer in the bronchoscopy group.40 A network meta-analysis found that bronchoscopy or ultrasound-guided percutaneous tracheostomy has similar rate of procedure-related complications.9 Ultrasound guidance may not be an alternative to bronchoscopic guidance, but rather an adjunct to bronchoscopy to potentially improve the safety profile in select cases. EVALUATION OF PATIENT FOR TRACHEOSTOMY A thorough clinical and anatomic evaluation should be performed before planning a PDT. Review of the clinical history including medication use, previous tracheostomy or neck surgery, bleeding disorders, evaluation of the neck anatomy for palpable cricoid cartilage or tracheal rings, palpable isthmus of the thyroid gland, cricoid to sternal distance, and ability to extend the neck are essential. Hemodynamically unstable, coagulopathic, and obese patients need careful risk stratification to avoid any complications. Depending on the clinical context, PDT on obese patients can be done safely by a skilled operator.12, In select patients with mild hemodynamic instability, PDT may be feasible, depending on the alternatives. Coagulopathy should in general be corrected prior to PDT, but if it is mild and cannot be corrected, then with a skilled operator and appropriate surgical backup it may be done if there are no alternatives. History of sedation tolerance is helpful to plan the procedural sedation. Platelet count and coagulopathy should be reviewed 24 h prior to procedure. There is a high risk of aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) during tracheostomy. Delaying the procedure for 10 days or until the patient is stable and able to tolerate apnea during creation of the stoma and insertion of TT may minimize risk of aerosolization.42 We perform PDT in COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) patients in a negative airflow room wearing full personal protective equipment with a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). After a decision for tracheostomy is made, informed consent should be obtained from the patient (if able), durable power of attorney (DPOA), or family for tracheostomy, bronchoscopy, and ultrasound examination (if planned). Risks, benefits, potential complications, and alternative options should be clearly explained to the patient or family. ANTICOAGULATION OR ANTIPLATELET THERAPY MANAGEMENT IN PERCUTANEOUS DILATIONAL TRACHEOSTOMY There are no specific guidelines on anticoagulation and antiplatelet management in patients undergoing PDT. The incidence of major bleeding requiring blood transfusions directly related to PDT is extremely low.43 However, general guidelines for perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy can be applied to PDT.44 The incidence of major and minor bleeding following PDT, in patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) receiving systemic heparinization, was 1.7 % and 31.4 %, respectively,45 with a median platelet count of 126, 000/μL and international normalized ratio (INR) 1.1, when heparin infusion was held 1 h before the procedure. Even with coagulation disorders (activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] > 50 s, prothrombin time [PT] < 50 %, INR > 1.4, or platelet < 50, 000/μL) there was mild bleeding without any need for surgical intervention or transfusion.46 Thus PDT is relatively safe in patients with coagulopathy and severe thrombocytopenia after correction.47–49 We recommend holding the heparin drip at least 3 h prior to the procedure and resuming heparin 3 h postprocedure. Subcutaneous heparin and enoxaparin should be held at least 12 h prior if they are receiving BID dosing. If they are receiving once-a-day therapeutic dosing of enoxaparin, it should be held for 24 h. Dual antiplatelet therapy preferably should be held\noplastin time [aPTT] > 50 s, prothrombin time [PT] < 50 %, INR > 1.4, or platelet < 50, 000/μL) there was mild bleeding without any need for surgical intervention or transfusion.46 Thus PDT is relatively safe in patients with coagulopathy and severe thrombocytopenia after correction.47–49 We recommend holding the heparin drip at least 3 h prior to the procedure and resuming heparin 3 h postprocedure. Subcutaneous heparin and enoxaparin should be held at least 12 h prior if they are receiving BID dosing. If they are receiving once-a-day therapeutic dosing of enoxaparin, it should be held for 24 h. Dual antiplatelet therapy preferably should be heldSECTION Additional IP Topics for 3–5 days. However, in the setting of recent cardiac stenting, PDT can be performed safely on clopidogrel50 with appropriate informed consent. Direct oral anticoagulation agents (DOAC) and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) should be bridged with unfractionated heparin if possible. DOAC should be held for two to three drug half-lives in cases with low risk of bleeding and four to five drug half-lives in high risk of bleeding. Renal dysfunction is also a key factor and desmopressin (DDAVP) can be used in uremic patients since platelets can be dysfunctional. There is no specific guidance on the use of antiangiogenic agents such as bevacizumab or other oral VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) such as sunitinib or cabozantinib during PDT. A French guideline recommends a delay of 2 days between implantation of an intravenous device and the initiation of bevacizumab, a delay of at least 5 weeks between the last dose of bevacizumab and invasive surgery, and a delay of 4 weeks between surgery and the initiation of bevacizumab treatment.51 PREPARATION FOR PERCUTANEOUS DILATIONAL TRACHEOSTOMY\nOnce the decision for bedside PDT is made, the plan should be communicated to the primary team, the nursing staff in the ICU, and the bronchoscopy team. A procedural checklist (Box 18.2) ensures that all necessary supplies, medications, and equipment are available at the bedside. Tube feeding should be held, or patients should be NPO for at least 4–6 h prior to the procedure. Anticoagulation should be managed as described earlier. Extra tubing for IV lines should be arranged to access the IV line during the procedure for medication administration without compromising the sterile field. The size of the ETT is verified to determine the appropriate size of the bronchoscope to be used during the procedure. SETUP AND TECHNIQUE\nPersonnel\nA primary operator and an assistant usually stand on either side of the patient ( The ventilator and bronchoscopy tower need to be placed closer to the bronchoscopist for easy access. The bronchoscope tower is positioned near the head of the bed and the bronchoscopy technician stands next to the tower. A circulating nurse is present to monitor the vitals and to administer medicine. A second nurse may be available depending on the institutional policy for documentation. All personnel in the room should wear appropriate personal protective equipment. The tracheostomy operator and the assistant, in addition, should wear sterile gloves and gown.

Continuous monitoring of blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and oxygen saturation is done during the procedure. BP should be checked every 2 min unless continuous arterial BP monitoring is available. Patients may become hypotensive after sedation and neuromuscular blockade. Phenylephrine or norepinephrine can be used if hypotension is unresponsive to saline bolus. Participation of an experienced RT is mandatory to avoid loss of the airway, especially during retraction of the ETT and securing the ETT when it is gently wedged into the glottis opening. Adequate ventilation is confirmed by monitoring the exhaled tidal volume and pulse oximetry. An alveolar recruitment maneuver may be needed if adequate oxygen saturation cannot by maintained during PDT on patients requiring PEEP > 12 mmHg or high Fio2. Technique After informed consent is verified, a time-out is performed, and the patient is laid supine. The bed is maximally inflated. The neck is usually hyperextended to bring the cricoid cartilage superiorly above the sternal notch by placing a roll of towels under the shoulders (provided no contraindication like rheumatoid arthritis or neck fusion is present). Beard or hair from the anterior neck area will need to be shaved. The Fio2 is increased to 100 % for the duration of the procedure. A checklist (Box 18.2) assures that all necessary equipment and supplies are readily available prior to the procedure. Landmarks such as the cricoid cartilage, sternal notch, and the tracheal rings are identified and marked. The distance between the cricoid and sternal notch is estimated. It is helpful to mark the anatomy and the incision site prior to the procedure, especially if trainees are involved. If the trachea can be palpated but is deep, we recommend using an extra-long TT. The anterior neck area is then sterilized using chlorhexidine swabs. A sterile drape is placed over the neck and the rest of the body. After adequate sedation is achieved, 2 % lidocaine is instilled through the ETT to further anesthetize the airways. A bronchoscope is introduced through the ETT for a quick airway examination.

After adequate sedation is achieved, a short-acting paralytic is given. The bronchoscopist then inserts the bronchoscope and places it near the distal tip of the ETT. Both the bronchoscope and the ETT are retracted by the RT as one unit very slowly to avoid accidental loss of the airway. The bronchoscopist observes the bronchoscope monitor to identify the location of the ETT. Once the ETT is retracted to the level of the cricoid cartilage, the cricothyroid membrane is identified with the bronchoscope. It is important to accurately identify the cricoid cartilage ( Once the insertion site is selected, a 1.5-cm long vertical skin incision is made along the midline. It is very critical not to make a deep incision initially to avoid damage to the deeper structures. The pretracheal tissue and deep fascia are then cleared with blunt dissection using a small mosquito Kelly clamp ( The tracheostomy operator then stabilizes the tracheal cartilage with the nondominant hand ( C\nD\nretracted by the RT as one unit very slowly to avoid accidental loss of the airway.

Once the ideal location is identified, the introducer needle is loaded on a syringe with 1 cm3 saline and is inserted between the first and the second or the second and the third cartilaginous interspaces in the midline (Figs. 18.4D and 18.5B). Entry into the trachea is visualized with the bronchoscope. Ideally, the introducer needle will enter the trachea along the midline at 12 o’clock or at least between 11 o’clock and 1 o’clock position ( Once optimal midline position is verified, a Seldinger technique is used. A J-tipped guidewire is inserted through the introducer needle and directed toward the distal trachea under bronchoscopic visualization ( A guidesheath is then placed over the guidewire and the curved tapered dilator (Figs. 18.4D and 18.5E) is inserted over the guidewire to dilate the stoma. Soaking the tapering dilator in saline activates the hydrophilic surface coating, making it slippery and easier to insert through the stoma. The guiding sheath on the guidewire minimizes the likelihood of accidental kinking of the guidewire. The dilator is then removed, leaving the guidewire and the guidesheath in place. The TT is then loaded on to an appropriate size dilator and positioned in such a way that the tapering end of the dilator is flushed with the end of the TT ( It is important to use a curved motion of the wrist to insert the TT to avoid direct pressure on the posterior tracheal wall.

The distal end of the TT should be at least 2–4 cm or more proximal to the main carina. Once placement is confirmed, the bronchoscope is removed, and the inner cannula with a 15-mm adapter is placed and connected to the ventilator circuit. The tracheostomy cuff is inflated, and tidal volume return is observed on the ventilator and used as a secondary confirmation of correct placement of the TT. The TT is then secured with sutures or Velcro tracheostomy neck ties. We recommend flexing the head when securing the tracheostomy tie and prefer to place a split-foam dressing ( Unless procedural difficulty was experienced during the procedure, there is no need to obtain a postprocedure chest radiograph.52 POST-TRACHEOSTOMY CARE\nInstitutional protocols assure uniform care by RT, nursing staff, house staff, and other providers. Postoperative complications such as accidental decannulation, bleeding, oxygen desaturation, and cuff leak should be brought to the attention of the appropriate service instantly. Even if the TT is secured with sutures and tracheostomy tie, the TT can get dislodged. The most common signs of TT dislodgement are that there is unexplained hypoxia, the RT is unable to insert the inline suction catheter, or there is loss of tidal volume. Accidental dislodgment can happen during regular nursing care such as turning, bathing, or when the TT is removed by an agitated patient. In our practice, we do not usually suture the TT and use the tracheostomy tie to secure the tube. Split-foam dressings ( In the event of accidental decannulation within the first 7 days, oral endotracheal intubation is recommended unless a provider experienced in tracheostomy management is available immediately. Attempting to reinsert the TT through a stoma in this context has a high risk of paratracheal placement in inexperienced hands. Regular monitoring of cuff pressure avoids tracheal mucosal injury. Purulent secretion at the tracheostomy site should be cleaned daily with antiseptic wound care. Sutures, if placed, should be removed in 5–7 days postprocedure, at the discretion of the provider. LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT\nPatients and their caregivers need to be educated on how to clean and care for the TT prior to the discharge unless the patient is transferred to a long-term acute care hospital or a ventilator weaning facility. An alternative to cleaning the inner cannula regularly is the use of disposable inner cannulas. Thick, crusty secretions can form with loss of filtration, heat, and moisture blocking the TT. Use of heat and moisture exchange (HME) filters prevents mucus plugging. Proper maintenance of TT mandates regular follow-up with a physician, respiratory therapist or speech therapist to assure optimal tracheostomy care. TT may be changed every 1–2 months (manufacturer recommendation is to change every 30 days), although no robust data are available to corroborate the recommendation. COMMON PROCEDURAL COMPLICATIONS\nPDT is a safe, reliable procedure with a low complication rate. Although PDT is becoming a routine procedure in the ICU setting, rare but serious complications can occur. It is strongly recommended that PDT be performed during the daytime, so surgical expertise and other resources are immediately available in the event of an emergency. Technical complications include misplacement of the insertion needle; kinking of the guidewire; paratracheal placement of the TT with creation of a false lumen; and posterior tracheal wall injury involving the mediastinum, esophagus and rarely pleural spaces, and TT cuff rupture (Box 18.3). The most common complication is bleeding. Usually it is venous, rarely arterial, and happens during neck dissection. Minor bleeding is controlled by applying pressure. On rare occasions, electro- or thermocautery can be used. However, there is an increased risk of fire with any cautery usage as the patient is on 100 % Fio2. Caution must be used to lower the Fio2 prior to cautery usage. It is a good idea to inform all the team members about the fire hazard and to remind them to lower the Fio2 to less than 40 % prior to cautery use, if cautery use is absolutely necessary.

However, if major bleeding cannotCHAPTER Percutaneous Tracheostomy be controlled, surgical intervention may be needed to explore the incision site to locate the bleeding vessel and ligate it. Anticipating the potential complications and understanding the anatomy and its variations are important to avoid bleeding from the brachiocephalic artery or a high-riding innominate artery.53, The second most common difficulty encountered is the appropriate placement of the introducer needle. Ideally it should be midline in between the first and second or the second and third tracheal rings. Stabilizing the trachea with the nondominant hand ( Placement of the TT at or on the cricoid cartilage may lead to higher risk of subglottic stenosis, whereas placement below the third tracheal ring increases the risk of bleeding from the brachiocephalic trunk. The skills and experience of the bronchoscopist are crucial to avoid complications. During retraction of the ETT, the airway may be lost by accidentally pulling the ETT out. Since the bronchoscope is already within the ETT, the best practice to correct this is to simply advance the bronchoscope through the vocal cords into the distal trachea and then reintubate by advancing the ETT over the bronchoscope into the mid-trachea. If this fails, direct laryngoscopy can be used to reintubate if the airway cannot be established immediately. During retraction of the ETT, identification of the cricoid cartilage can often be challenging, as all the cartilaginous interspaces appear similar on bronchoscopic examination. The cricoid cartilage can be identified by its distinct appearance just below the cricothyroid membrane ( Bronchoscopic guidance is paramount to prevent posterior wall injury during needle placement or dilation.

Subcutaneous emphysema occurs when air dissects through the trachea or subcutaneous tissue plane into the neck fascia and the mediastinum. A chest tube may be needed for pneumothorax, especially if the patient is mechanically ventilated. Thoracic surgery assistance may be needed in case of pneumomediastinum or tracheoesophageal fistula caused by posterior wall injury. If there is any difficulty inserting the TT, it should be withdrawn, and the stoma dilated again. If a guidewire is found to be kinked, rapid reexploration of the wound and airway examination should be done with the bronchoscope, both through the ETT and through the stoma to rule out any airway injury. In obese patients or in those with a deep neck but palpable trachea, a regular TT may be too short and may predispose to cuff leak. A longer TT ( Other reported complications include fracture of the tracheal ring during the stoma dilation. Usually no intervention is needed for tracheal cartilage fracture. Late complications occur after the first 24 h and include delayed hemorrhage, infection, skin breakdown, tracheal stenosis, tracheoinnominate artery fistula, or tracheoesophageal fistula. Delayed hemorrhage can occur due to erosion of the anterior tracheal wall by the distal end of the TT. Any bleeding through the TT needs to be evaluated urgently to rule out tracheoinnominate artery fistula until proven otherwise. Computed tomography (CT) angiography may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Otolaryngology and surgical consultation are mandatory. Stable and slow bleeding can be managed with exploration of the stoma and careful examination of the trachea. Local cauterization controls mild stomal bleeding in most cases. In difficult cases, the patient may be intubated orally with an ETT, and the inflated cuff can tamponade the bleeding vessel temporarily to allow the patient to be transferred to a controlled setting like the operating room or procedure suite for exploration. Skin bleeders are controlled by cautery or packing with absorbable hemostat. Local skin infections around the tracheostomy site, stoma infection, or tracheitis occur frequently. Wound infection extending into the mediastinum may result in mediastinitis. Prevention of tracheitis can be accomplished by frequent irrigation and suctioning of the tube. Overall, skin-related complications or infections occur less frequently in PDT compared to ST.55 Management includes antiseptic stomal toileting, maintaining moisture, removal and cleaning of the inner cannula two to three times daily, and topical or systemic antibiotics. Early tracheoesophageal fistula can be seen with posterior wall injury during the procedure and late tracheoesophageal fistula can occur due to erosion from prolonged use of an inflated cuffed tube. For immediate management, a longer TT passing beyond the distal end of the fistula can be used. However, tracheoesophageal fistula requires surgical correction with the closure of the defects. Typical presentation of tracheal stenosis includes dyspnea on exertion, increasing cough, and stridor if the tracheal lumen narrowed by less than 50 %. Obstruction by granulation tissue may be managed with cryotherapy, laser, or cautery. Switching to an uncuffed TT or deflating the cuff when no longer requiring the ventilator may be a practical option. TRAINING AND PROCEDURAL COMPETENCY Perioperative and late complications are lower after the first 20 procedures, suggesting a learning curve. Although the technique can be mastered after 5–10 supervised procedures, performance of at least 50 procedures assures exposure to rare complications. SUMMARY PDT is a minimally invasive, cost-effective, routine procedure done at the bedside on critically ill patients. Complication rates are operator dependent and minimal in expert hands. Bronchoscopic guidance minimizes procedural risk.56 Appropriate patient selection and planning is the key to avoiding complications. The procedure can be done at the bedside in the ICU efficiently.
