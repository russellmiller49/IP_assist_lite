Ablative techniques that destroy tissue are useful for endobronchial obstruction. Ablative techniques include lasers, electrocautery, argon plasma coagulation (APC), photodynamic therapy, microdebriders, and cryotherapy. Stents are the primary modality used for patients with extrinsic compression. For mixed patterns, multiple modalities are usually required. Practice patterns vary signifi cantly between bronchoscopists in terms of the type of bronchoscopy used (fl exible vs rigid), ablative technique preferred (eg, laser vs electrocautery), and stent strategy and preference (eg, silicone vs metal). Whether these practice variations impact eff ectiveness is unknown.\nPrior studies of therapeutic bronchoscopy for central airway obstruction 2-6 have included both malignant and benign cases, and most were done retrospectively. However, outcomes and complications diff er signifi cantly depending upon the indication (eg, malignant airway obstruction vs postintubation tracheal stenosis). In many studies there was signifi cant heterogeneity in terms of patient population and indications. 1,3,4 Other studies have focused on individual technologies, such as microdebriders 3 or APC. 7 Th ese studies are useful for evaluating new technologies, but they are not designed\nto show comparative eff ectiveness. In clinical practice, a multimodality approach using a variety of technologies is the norm, but there is relatively scant evidence comparing techniques. In addition, the impact of interventions on quality of life has not always been quantifi ed with validated instruments. Th is makes clinical decisionmaking more diffi cult, since physicians must be able to quantify the potential benefi ts and weigh them against the risks. Finally, most of these studies were performed at centers of excellence as part of clinical research studies and used relatively small and highly selected patient populations. Whether these results can be generalized to everyday clinical practice is unknown. 8,9\nWe used the American College of Chest Physicians Quality Improvement Registry, Evaluation, and Education (AQuIRE) program to evaluate therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction. Registries off er the benefi t of providing clinical eff ectiveness data that are more generalizable than those obtained from more focused clinical trials. 8,9 Our primary objective was to quantify the technical success rate of therapeutic bronchoscopy, defi ned as anatomic reopening of the airways, and to identify techniques and factors associated with technical success. Secondary objectives were to assess the impact of therapeutic bronchoscopy on dyspnea and changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a subset of these patients. Data on complications are presented separately.\n\n## aterials and Methods\n\nPatients undergoing therapeutic bronchoscopy from January 2009 to February 2013 were entered into AQuIRE. 10 Not all centers started participating at the same time; some centers participated for the entire duration, and others participated for \u2265 1 year. However, participating physicians agreed to enter all consecutive patients for the duration of their participation. Institutional review board approval was obtained from Th e University of Texas MD Anderson institutional review board committee 4, protocol DR09-0101 ( e-Appendix 1 ). Th e principal investigator for each site was primarily responsible for data quality for that site. Informed consent or a waiver of consent was obtained in accordance with institutional guidelines. Data were entered via the AQuIRE web-based interface using standardized defi nitions, quality control checks, and protocols as previously described . 8,9,11\nPatients undergoing therapeutic flexible or rigid bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction were included.

Technical success was based on anatomic criteria and was defi ned bronchoscopically as reopening the airway lumen to . 50% of the normal diameter. Th e airway also had to connect to a viable area of distal lung. If a physician successfully reopened a proximal airway, only to discover that there was distal disease that occluded all the segmental and subsegmental levels, this was classifi ed as a technical failure. All clinical outcomes were assessed by the attending physician using standardized defi nitions from a code book. See e-Appendix 1 for additional details on defi nitions. Center volume was determined by calculating the average number of cases per month for each center, and this was used as a center-level variable in hierarchical models. A subset of centers agreed prospectively to collect preprocedure and 30-day postprocedure data on dyspnea and self-reported HRQOL. Dyspnea was measured using the Borg score, and HRQOL was measured using the SF -6D. 12 Th e SF-6D provides a means to estimate a preference-based single index measure for health using general population data.\nTh e primary outcome was technical success of the procedure. All centers decided in advance whether to collect additional data on dyspnea and HRQOL, since this was an optional module within AQuIRE because most centers do not collect these data as part of their routine clinical care. A secondary analysis was conducted to analyze the outcomes of change in dyspnea as measured by the Borg score and changes in utility as derived from the SF-6D, only using the data from those centers that agreed in advance to participate in that module.\n\n## tatistical Analysis\n\nFor binary outcomes, the association of the outcome with each of the covariates was checked by x 2 test or Fisher exact test or WilcoxonMann-Whitney two-sample test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test as appropriate. For continuous outcomes, the association of the outcome with each of the covariates was checked by F test in analysis of variance models or t test in linear regression models, as appropriate. Change in dyspnea was calculated as postprocedure 2 preprocedure Borg score ( \u0394 Borg). For responder analysis we used a \u0394 Borg of \u2264 2 1 to defi ne patients having a clinically signifi cant improvement in dyspnea. Th is was based on the minimal clinically important diff erence (MCID) of the Borg score, which is a one-unit change. 13,14 Change in utility was calculated as postprocedure 2 preprocedure utility ( \u0394 utility) among patients alive 30 days aft er the procedure. For responder analysis we used a \u0394 utility of 1 0.033 to defi ne patients having a clinically signifi cant improvement in utility. Th is was based on the MCID of the SF-6D. 15 Variables that had P values , .20 on univariate analyses were candidates for multivariate models. Predictive models used only clinical information available preprocedure; explanatory models used all available information. Multivariate models used backward selection to retain only variables with P values , .05. To control for regression to the mean when analyzing \u0394 Borg, we included baseline Borg in the multivariate models. 16 Additional information on models and controlling for regression to the mean are in e-Appendix 1 . We used hierarchical models to evaluate the impact of center-level variation on homogeneity. Logistic regression using the maximum likelihood approach was used. For continuous outcomes, an analysis of covariance model was used. P values , .05 were considered to be signifi cant; all tests were two-sided. All statistical analyses were performed in SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).\n\n## esults\n\nFift een centers with 26 physicians enrolled 947 patients who had 1,115 procedures. Baseline patient and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Th ere were signifi cant variations in practice patterns between centers in location of care ( P , .001), anesthesia ( P , .001), ventilation ( P , .001), rigid bronchoscopy ( P , .001), ablative techniques ( P , .001), stent use ( P , .001), and types of stents used ( P , .001).\n\n## echnical Success of the Procedure\n\nOut of the 1,115 procedures, 1,039 (93%) were technically successful ( . 50% success) ( Table 2 ) . On multivariate analysis, endobronchial obstruction and stent placement were associated with higher technical success rates, whereas American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score . 3, renal failure, primary lung cancer, left mainstem disease, and tracheoesophageal fi stula were associated with lower technical success rates. Among the eight centers that had data on 25 or more cases (n 5 1,052), success rates ranged from 90% to 98% ( P 5 .02). We evaluated center-level impact on homogeneity, but the model did not converge if smaller centers were included. When we used only larger centers, we failed to fi nd evidence of heterogeneity, and we did not fi nd evidence of a relationship between center volume and\nsuccess rates. Th is is not to say that centers had the same outcomes, but rather that aft er evaluating for other covariates the between-center variance was negligible.\n\n## yspnea\n\nA total of 187 patients had pre- and post-Borg scores measured. We compared this dyspnea assessment subset to other patients from the same centers who did not have dyspnea data collected. We found that the dyspnea assessment subsets were more likely to have elective procedures ( P 5 .006), be inpatients ( P , .001), and have rigid bronchoscopy ( P , .001). In all other regards they were similar ( e-Table 1 ).\nDyspnea decreased following intervention (mean \u0394 Borg, 2 0.9 \u00b1 2.2; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P , .0001). Note that since lower Borg scores indicate less dyspnea, if \u0394 Borg is negative, then there has been a decrease in dyspnea from preprocedure to postprocedure. On multivariate analysis, a one-unit increase of baseline Borg score was found to be associated with a 0.63-unit decrease in \u0394 Borg ( P , .0001), indicating that higher baseline Borg scores were associated with greater improvements in dyspnea ( Table 3 ) . Conversely, smokers, patients with another primary solid tumor, and patients with lobar obstruction tended to have a higher \u0394 Borg, indicating that these\n\n## able 1 ] Patient and Clinical Characteristics of Procedures\n\n(Continued)\nData are given as No. (%) unless otherwise indicated.

There was no difference between predictive and explanatory models.\nIn a responder analysis, 90 of the 187 patients (48%) had a clinically signifi cant improvement in dyspnea, 81 (43%) stayed the same, and 16 (9%) worsened ( e-Table 2 ).

Note that lower Borg scores indicate less dyspnea, so a negative post - pre score indicates improvements in dyspnea.

Pre- and post-utility scores were measured in 183 patients. HRQOL improved following intervention (mean \u0394 utility, 0.023 \u00b1 0.107 utiles; paired t test, P 5 .004). In multivariate predictive analysis, higher baseline Borg score and not having lobar obstruction were associated with greater improvements in HRQOL ( Table 4 ) . In an explanatory multivariate analysis ( e-Table 3 ), lower baseline utility, absence of tracheal obstruction, absence of bronchus intermedius obstruction, and greater improvements in dyspnea postprocedure (ie, more negative \u0394 Borg) were associated with greater improvements in utility. A one-unit increase in \u0394 Borg (ie, more dyspnea) resulted in a decrease in \u0394 utility of 0.020 utiles ( P , .0001).\nIn a responder analysis, 76 of the 183 patients (42%) had a clinically signifi cant improvement in utility, 61 (33%) stayed the same, and 46 (25%) worsened ( e-Table 4 ). In a multivariate predictive analysis, Zubrod score . 1, not having extrinsic airway compression, and fl exible bronchoscopy were associated with clinically signifi cant improvements in utility.\n\n## dverse Events\n\nComplication occurred in 44 of the 1,115 procedures (3.9%). Th ere was signifi cant variation between centers (range, 0.9%-11.7%; P 5 .002) in complication rates. Six patients (0.5%) died secondary to procedural complications. Factors associated with complications included ASA . 3 ( P 5 .0002) and Zubrod . 1 ( P 5 .02). Th e 30-day mortality was 14.8%. Th ere was signifi cant variation between centers (range, 7.7%-20.2%; P 5 .02). Risk factors for 30-day mortality included ASA . 3 ( P \u2264 0.0001) and Zubrod . 1 ( P , .0001). Detailed data and analysis of risk factors for complications and 30-day mortality are presented separately.\n\n## iscussion\n\nTh erapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction is essentially a palliative intervention, since most patients have advanced disease that is incurable. Although therapeutic bronchoscopy in this setting may indeed prolong life modestly for some patients (eg, enable them to get off the ventilator), the majority of patients benefi t from changes in quality of life rather than duration. When comparing the eff ectiveness of various therapeutic bronchoscopy techniques, it is therefore important to consider technical success and the subsequent impact on dyspnea and HRQOL. Th e potential benefi ts in HRQOL must then be weighed against the risks associated with the intervention. In this study, we found that although there were signifi cant diff erences in technique between centers, technical success was usually achieved. Th ere were diff erences between centers in the rate of technical success, but these were relatively modest. However, technical success did not always result in a meaningful improvement in dyspnea. Patients who were more short of breath at baseline were more likely to experience improvements in dyspnea, whereas those with lobar disease were less likely to improve. Similarly, HRQOL improvements were greatest in patients with more dyspnea at baseline, whereas those with lobar disease were less likely to improve. HRQOL improvement was also associated with higher ASA score and lower functional status. Th us, patients at the highest risk for complications also had the greatest potential for benefi t.\nOur study is consistent with and adds to the existing body of evidence by comparing alternative technologies and quantifying the nature and magnitude of the benefi ts of therapeutic bronchoscopy more precisely. 1,2,4,5,17-24 Prior studies oft en involved single centers and focused on particular technologies. Because of this, the populations were highly selected and not large enough to compare alternative approaches. Consistent with prior studies, we found a high rate of technical success (93%) with a modest amount of variation in success rates between centers. In addition, because of the number of centers and physicians involved, we were able to compare alternative techniques. We found there was no single best method in terms of ablative techniques. In addition, we found that stenting was associated with higher technical success rates. Th is association is not necessarily causal, since some patients may prove to have extensive disease beyond the central airways, such that the physician may deem that stenting is of no benefi t. Hence there may be confounding by indication present, so caution is warranted when analyzing the factors associated with technical success.\nHowever, measuring technical success alone is not suffi -cient, since palliation of dyspnea and improvement in HRQOL is the primary clinical goal. Many prior studies were case series and focused on feasibility, proof of concept, and quantifying risks with less emphasis on quantifying impact on HRQOL. 1,2,4,5,17-23 In our subset analysis, 48% of patients had a clinically signifi cant\n(Continued)\n[ 1 4 7\n# 5\nCHEST\nMAY 2 0 1 5\n]\n(Continued)\n\n## able 4 ] (continued)\n\nData are given as mean (SD) unless otherwise indicated.

Th is is consistent with prior studies of therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction, which also demonstrated improvements in dyspnea and HRQOL as measured by disease-specifi c instruments. 2,4,5,17-23 Although useful, these prior studies are not suffi cient to fully inform clinical decision-making, because the trade-off s involve different units that cannot be easily compared. For example, what risk of death is acceptable to achieve success, when success is defi ned as relief of anatomic obstruction? What if we defi ne success in terms of dyspnea? Since therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction is essentially palliative, we need to quantify the HRQOL gains in units that allow physicians to compare the benefi ts accrued to the risks incurred. Th is requires a specifi c type of HRQOL instrument-a generic single-index measure such as the SF-6D that can be used to calculate utilities (additional details on HRQOL instruments can be found in e-Appendix 1 ).\nTh is is the fi rst report, to our knowledge, of therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction from a multicenter registry that evaluates technical success and dyspnea relief and combines it with an analysis of utility. Th e MCID for the SF-6D has been estimated to be 0.033 (95% CI, 0.029-0.037). 15,25 Th is is similar to the MCID for other indirect utility measures, such as the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HU12), Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HU13), and EQ-5D . 25,26 Our data suggest that when baseline dyspnea is higher, interventions have a greater impact on utility. We also found that patients with more severe functional impairment were more likely to benefi t from intervention. Of note, with respect to the outcomes of dyspnea relief and utility, there was no single best method in terms of ablative techniques, and there was no single best type of stent.\nTh is study provides a more accurate assessment of the relationship between baseline dyspnea, improvements in dyspnea, the resulting improvement in utility, and how physicians might use this to weigh the benefi ts of intervention vs the possibility of procedure-related complications. Specifi cally, although high ASA score and more severe functional impairment predict increased risk of complications and adverse events, the benefi ts of intervention are also higher and probably warrant careful consideration. Based on these fi ndings, high levels of functional impairment and high surgical risk should not necessarily preclude bronchoscopic intervention, provided that there is signifi cant dyspnea and that the dyspnea is contributing to the patient's poor performance status.\nAlthough these fi ndings are useful, it is important to recognize the limitations of the data. Although we did fi nd that stenting was associated with higher technical success rates, this needs to be weighed against the risk of longer-term complications that may arise. 27-29 Similarly, although this is the fi rst study to our knowledge to evaluate change in utility following therapeutic bronchoscopy, the outcomes measured are short term (ie, 30 days). Longer term studies that measure quality-adjusted survival beyond 30 days will be needed so that qualityadjusted life years can be determined. Th is has been done for malignant pleural eff usions, and a similar method could be used for therapeutic bronchoscopy. 30 In addition, although we did not fi nd evidence of a relationship between average number of cases per month and technical success rates, the number of patients enrolled from low-volume centers was small. Th erefore, the fi ndings on volume-outcome relationships should be considered as limited and preliminary. In addition, the data on dyspnea and HRQOL were available for only a subset of patients from select centers, and these patients diff ered from the rest of the cohort in some regards, so the generalizability of the fi ndings needs to be verifi ed. Finally, the indications for the procedures may have diff ered in subtle but signifi cant ways. Physicians may choose to intervene 'early' for lesions that are anatomically signifi cant ( . 50% stenosis) even when patients do not have dyspnea, if the perception is that the disease is likely to progress. In such instances, improvements in dyspnea and even HRQOL are likely to be small. Th is does not necessarily mean that such early interventions are ineff ective, since they presumably prevent future deterioration and may allow procedures to be done in an elective manner while patients are more stable. As such, predictors of impact on dyspnea and HRQOL may be subject to subtle confounding by indication, since the indication for some of these procedures may be to avoid future deterioration in dyspnea and HRQOL, whereas in other instances the indication is for immediate relief.\nIn conclusion, this report from the AQuIRE registry is the fi rst multicenter registry study, to our knowledge, of therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction to evaluate patient and hospital predictors of technical success, impact on dyspnea, and changes in utility. Procedures were usually technically successful, with 93% of patients having their central airways reopened. No single ablative technology was superior in terms of achieving technical success, although stenting was associated with improved success\n\n## cknowledgments\n\nAuthor contributions: D. E.

Th e decision process therefore\nrequires not only risk assessment but also consideration of the magnitude of the potential benefi ts.

Th e primary outcome was technical success, defi ned as reopening the airway lumen to . 50% of normal. Secondary outcomes were dyspnea as measured by the Borg score and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as measured by the SF-6D .\nRESULTS: Fift een centers performed 1,115 procedures on 947 patients. Technical success was achieved in 93% of procedures. Center success rates ranged from 90% to 98% ( P 5 .02). Endobronchial obstruction and stent placement were associated with success, whereas American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score . 3, renal failure, primary lung cancer, left mainstem disease, and tracheoesophageal fistula were associated with failure. Clinically significant improvements in dyspnea occurred in 90 of 187 patients measured (48%). Greater baseline dyspnea was associated with greater improvements in dyspnea, whereas smoking, having multiple cancers, and lobar obstruction were associated with smaller improvements. Clinically signifi cant improvements in HRQOL occurred in 76 of 183 patients measured (42%). Greater baseline dyspnea was associated with greater improvements in HRQOL, and lobar obstruction was associated with smaller improvements.\nCONCLUSIONS: Technical success rates were high overall, with the highest success rates associated with stent placement and endobronchial obstruction. Th erapeutic bronchoscopy should not be withheld from patients based solely on an assessment of risk, since patients with the most dyspnea and lowest functional status benefi tted the most.

Ablative techniques that destroy tissue are useful for endobronchial obstruction. Ablative techniques include lasers, electrocautery, argon plasma coagulation (APC), photodynamic therapy, microdebriders, and cryotherapy. Stents are the primary modality used for patients with extrinsic compression. For mixed patterns, multiple modalities are usually required. Practice patterns vary signifi cantly between bronchoscopists in terms of the type of bronchoscopy used (fl exible vs rigid), ablative technique preferred (eg, laser vs electrocautery), and stent strategy and preference (eg, silicone vs metal). Whether these practice variations impact eff ectiveness is unknown.\nPrior studies of therapeutic bronchoscopy for central airway obstruction 2-6 have included both malignant and benign cases, and most were done retrospectively. However, outcomes and complications diff er signifi cantly depending upon the indication (eg, malignant airway obstruction vs postintubation tracheal stenosis). In many studies there was signifi cant heterogeneity in terms of patient population and indications. 1,3,4 Other studies have focused on individual technologies, such as microdebriders 3 or APC. 7 Th ese studies are useful for evaluating new technologies, but they are not designed\nto show comparative eff ectiveness. In clinical practice, a multimodality approach using a variety of technologies is the norm, but there is relatively scant evidence comparing techniques. In addition, the impact of interventions on quality of life has not always been quantifi ed with validated instruments. Th is makes clinical decisionmaking more diffi cult, since physicians must be able to quantify the potential benefi ts and weigh them against the risks. Finally, most of these studies were performed at centers of excellence as part of clinical research studies and used relatively small and highly selected patient populations. Whether these results can be generalized to everyday clinical practice is unknown. 8,9\nWe used the American College of Chest Physicians Quality Improvement Registry, Evaluation, and Education (AQuIRE) program to evaluate therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction. Registries off er the benefi t of providing clinical eff ectiveness data that are more generalizable than those obtained from more focused clinical trials. 8,9 Our primary objective was to quantify the technical success rate of therapeutic bronchoscopy, defi ned as anatomic reopening of the airways, and to identify techniques and factors associated with technical success. Secondary objectives were to assess the impact of therapeutic bronchoscopy on dyspnea and changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a subset of these patients. Data on complications are presented separately.",

Technical success was based on anatomic criteria and was defi ned bronchoscopically as reopening the airway lumen to . 50% of the normal diameter. Th e airway also had to connect to a viable area of distal lung. If a physician successfully reopened a proximal airway, only to discover that there was distal disease that occluded all the segmental and subsegmental levels, this was classifi ed as a technical failure. All clinical outcomes were assessed by the attending physician using standardized defi nitions from a code book. See e-Appendix 1 for additional details on defi nitions. Center volume was determined by calculating the average number of cases per month for each center, and this was used as a center-level variable in hierarchical models. A subset of centers agreed prospectively to collect preprocedure and 30-day postprocedure data on dyspnea and self-reported HRQOL. Dyspnea was measured using the Borg score, and HRQOL was measured using the SF -6D. 12 Th e SF-6D provides a means to estimate a preference-based single index measure for health using general population data.\nTh e primary outcome was technical success of the procedure. All centers decided in advance whether to collect additional data on dyspnea and HRQOL, since this was an optional module within AQuIRE because most centers do not collect these data as part of their routine clinical care. A secondary analysis was conducted to analyze the outcomes of change in dyspnea as measured by the Borg score and changes in utility as derived from the SF-6D, only using the data from those centers that agreed in advance to participate in that module.",

      "content": "Th erapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction is essentially a palliative intervention, since most patients have advanced disease that is incurable. Although therapeutic bronchoscopy in this setting may indeed prolong life modestly for some patients (eg, enable them to get off the ventilator), the majority of patients benefi t from changes in quality of life rather than duration. When comparing the eff ectiveness of various therapeutic bronchoscopy techniques, it is therefore important to consider technical success and the subsequent impact on dyspnea and HRQOL. Th e potential benefi ts in HRQOL must then be weighed against the risks associated with the intervention. In this study, we found that although there were signifi cant diff erences in technique between centers, technical success was usually achieved. Th ere were diff erences between centers in the rate of technical success, but these were relatively modest. However, technical success did not always result in a meaningful improvement in dyspnea. Patients who were more short of breath at baseline were more likely to experience improvements in dyspnea, whereas those with lobar disease were less likely to improve. Similarly, HRQOL improvements were greatest in patients with more dyspnea at baseline, whereas those with lobar disease were less likely to improve. HRQOL improvement was also associated with higher ASA score and lower functional status. Th us, patients at the highest risk for complications also had the greatest potential for benefi t.\nOur study is consistent with and adds to the existing body of evidence by comparing alternative technologies and quantifying the nature and magnitude of the benefi ts of therapeutic bronchoscopy more precisely. 1,2,4,5,17-24 Prior studies oft en involved single centers and focused on particular technologies. Because of this, the populations were highly selected and not large enough to compare alternative approaches. Consistent with prior studies, we found a high rate of technical success (93%) with a modest amount of variation in success rates between centers. In addition, because of the number of centers and physicians involved, we were able to compare alternative techniques. We found there was no single best method in terms of ablative techniques. In addition, we found that stenting was associated with higher technical success rates. Th is association is not necessarily causal, since some patients may prove to have extensive disease beyond the central airways, such that the physician may deem that stenting is of no benefi t. Hence there may be confounding by indication present, so caution is warranted when analyzing the factors associated with technical success.\nHowever, measuring technical success alone is not suffi -cient, since palliation of dyspnea and improvement in HRQOL is the primary clinical goal. Many prior studies were case series and focused on feasibility, proof of concept, and quantifying risks with less emphasis on quantifying impact on HRQOL. 1,2,4,5,17-23 In our subset analysis, 48% of patients had a clinically signifi cant\n(Continued)\n[ 1 4 7\n# 5\nCHEST\nMAY 2 0 1 5\n]\n(Continued)",

Th is is consistent with prior studies of therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction, which also demonstrated improvements in dyspnea and HRQOL as measured by disease-specifi c instruments. 2,4,5,17-23 Although useful, these prior studies are not suffi cient to fully inform clinical decision-making, because the trade-off s involve different units that cannot be easily compared. For example, what risk of death is acceptable to achieve success, when success is defi ned as relief of anatomic obstruction? What if we defi ne success in terms of dyspnea? Since therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction is essentially palliative, we need to quantify the HRQOL gains in units that allow physicians to compare the benefi ts accrued to the risks incurred. Th is requires a specifi c type of HRQOL instrument-a generic single-index measure such as the SF-6D that can be used to calculate utilities (additional details on HRQOL instruments can be found in e-Appendix 1 ).\nTh is is the fi rst report, to our knowledge, of therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction from a multicenter registry that evaluates technical success and dyspnea relief and combines it with an analysis of utility. Th e MCID for the SF-6D has been estimated to be 0.033 (95% CI, 0.029-0.037). 15,25 Th is is similar to the MCID for other indirect utility measures, such as the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HU12), Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HU13), and EQ-5D . 25,26 Our data suggest that when baseline dyspnea is higher, interventions have a greater impact on utility. We also found that patients with more severe functional impairment were more likely to benefi t from intervention. Of note, with respect to the outcomes of dyspnea relief and utility, there was no single best method in terms of ablative techniques, and there was no single best type of stent.\nTh is study provides a more accurate assessment of the relationship between baseline dyspnea, improvements in dyspnea, the resulting improvement in utility, and how physicians might use this to weigh the benefi ts of intervention vs the possibility of procedure-related complications. Specifi cally, although high ASA score and more severe functional impairment predict increased risk of complications and adverse events, the benefi ts of intervention are also higher and probably warrant careful consideration. Based on these fi ndings, high levels of functional impairment and high surgical risk should not necessarily preclude bronchoscopic intervention, provided that there is signifi cant dyspnea and that the dyspnea is contributing to the patient's poor performance status.\nAlthough these fi ndings are useful, it is important to recognize the limitations of the data. Although we did fi nd that stenting was associated with higher technical success rates, this needs to be weighed against the risk of longer-term complications that may arise. 27-29 Similarly, although this is the fi rst study to our knowledge to evaluate change in utility following therapeutic bronchoscopy, the outcomes measured are short term (ie, 30 days). Longer term studies that measure quality-adjusted survival beyond 30 days will be needed so that qualityadjusted life years can be determined. Th is has been done for malignant pleural eff usions, and a similar method could be used for therapeutic bronchoscopy. 30 In addition, although we did not fi nd evidence of a relationship between average number of cases per month and technical success rates, the number of patients enrolled from low-volume centers was small. Th erefore, the fi ndings on volume-outcome relationships should be considered as limited and preliminary. In addition, the data on dyspnea and HRQOL were available for only a subset of patients from select centers, and these patients diff ered from the rest of the cohort in some regards, so the generalizability of the fi ndings needs to be verifi ed. Finally, the indications for the procedures may have diff ered in subtle but signifi cant ways. Physicians may choose to intervene 'early' for lesions that are anatomically signifi cant ( . 50% stenosis) even when patients do not have dyspnea, if the perception is that the disease is likely to progress. In such instances, improvements in dyspnea and even HRQOL are likely to be small. Th is does not necessarily mean that such early interventions are ineff ective, since they presumably prevent future deterioration and may allow procedures to be done in an elective manner while patients are more stable. As such, predictors of impact on dyspnea and HRQOL may be subject to subtle confounding by indication, since the indication for some of these procedures may be to avoid future deterioration in dyspnea and HRQOL, whereas in other instances the indication is for immediate relief.\nIn conclusion, this report from the AQuIRE registry is the fi rst multicenter registry study, to our knowledge, of therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction to evaluate patient and hospital predictors of technical success, impact on dyspnea, and changes in utility. Procedures were usually technically successful, with 93% of patients having their central airways reopened. No single ablative technology was superior in terms of achieving technical success, although stenting was associated with improved success",

Th erapeutic bronchoscopy should not be withheld from patients based solely on an assessment of the risks involved, since patients at the highest risk recognized the greatest benefi ts. Th e decision process therefore\nrequires not only risk assessment but also consideration of the magnitude of the potential benefi ts. Future studies should explore the interactions between hospital-level and patient-level variables on outcomes.
