Patients with symptomatic malignant pleural e/uniFB00usions were randomly assigned (1:1) to the aggressive (daily) or symptom-guided drainage groups for 60 days and minimised by cancer type (mesothelioma vs others), performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] score 0-1 vs \u22652), presence of trapped lung, and prior pleurodesis.

Few data exist to guide drainage approaches for patients with an indwelling pleural catheter. Practices vary worldwide, ranging from aggressive (daily or alternate\u00adday) drainage, often used in centres in the USA, 6 to drainage only when symptoms develop, which is common in the rest of the world. These di/uniFB00erences in practice could potentially influence outcomes and complication rates.\nAggressive daily drainage arguably keeps the pleural space dry and provides best symptom control every day, whereas health\u00adcare practitioners who advocate symptom\u00ad guided drainage contend that the goal of malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion care is palliation and that drainage of indwelling pleural catheter is only indicated when symptoms arise. The symptom\u00adguided approach might reduce a substantial amount of burden and consumable costs compared with daily drainage, and might reduce the risk of iatrogenic introduction of pleural infection.\nConversely, frequent indwelling pleural catheter drainage might facilitate approximation of the visceral and parietal pleura and facilitate their symphysis (so\u00adcalled spontaneous pleurodesis), and allow removal of the catheter. Daily drainage has been shown to promote pleurodesis more e/uniFB00ectively than alternate\u00adday drainage. 6 Whether a symptom\u00adguided approach a/uniFB00ects the rate of pleurodesis is unknown.\nThe Australasian Malignant PLeural E/uniFB00usion\u00ad2 (AMPLE\u00ad2) study was designed to address the equipoise between aggressive (daily) versus symptom\u00adguided approaches to indwelling pleural catheter drainage in patients with a malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion-specifically, their efficacy in breathlessness control, induction of pleurodesis, improvement of quality of life, reduction of days spent in hospital, and complication rates. 7\n\n## tudy design and patients\n\nThe AMPLE\u00ad2 study was a randomised, multicentre, open\u00ad label trial. Patients were enrolled from 11 centres: Sir Charles Gairdner, Fiona Stanley, Royal Perth, Saint John of God Bunbury, Sunshine Coast University, Royal Adelaide, Wesley, and St George & The Sutherland Hospitals in Australia; Middlemore Hospital in New Zealand; Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Kota Kinabalu, in Malaysia; and Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong. The study protocol has been published. 7 Ethics and governance approvals were obtained from the human research ethics committee at all sites, with the primary committee being the Sir Charles Gairdner and Osborne Park Health Care Group Human Research and Ethics Committee (2014-079). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.\nAll patients enrolled were adults who required in\u00ad dwelling pleural catheter placement for management of\n\n## vidence before the study\n\nMalignant pleural effusions often require pleural intervention for symptom control. Results of two multicentre trials have confirmed that an indwelling pleural catheter provides similar benefits to conventional talc slurry pleurodesis with regard to symptom control and quality of life. The AMPLE-1 randomised trial found that an indwelling pleural catheter provided added advantages over talc pleurodesis in reducing days spent in hospital, in patients' remaining lifespan, and in minimising the need for repeat invasive pleural drainage procedures. Having established the advantages and safety of indwelling pleural catheter insertion for management of malignant pleural effusions, the next step was to optimise its effectiveness by identifying its best drainage regimen. We searched PubMed for articles published before March 1, 2018, using the terms 'malignant pleural effusion' AND 'indwelling pleural catheter OR IPC' AND 'drainage frequency' AND 'breathlessness OR dyspnoea'. The only randomised controlled trial in the 11 articles found compared rates of spontaneous pleurodesis between daily drainage versus alternate-day drainage in 149 patients with malignant pleural effusions. However, many clinicians preferred drainage only when patients developed symptomatic breathlessness, as malignant pleural effusion management is mainly palliative. Aggressive (daily) versus infrequent symptom-guided drainage regimens have not been compared but have substantial implications for clinical care.\n\n## dded value of this study\n\nThe AMPLE-2 study addresses this equipoise by randomly assigning 87 patients with malignant pleural effusion to aggressive or symptom-guided drainage regimens via an indwelling pleural catheter. Both approaches provided similar breathlessness control over 60 days after randomisation. Pain scores, days spent in hospital, serious adverse events, and mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups. Aggressive drainage was associated with higher rates of pleurodesis than symptom-guided drainage and better index values on EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) quality-of-life assessment.\n\n## mplications of all the available evidence\n\nFor patients with malignant pleural effusion treated with an indwelling pleural catheter in whom early catheter removal is an important goal, daily drainage should be carried out for at least 60 days. For patients whose primary care aim is palliation, our data suggest that symptom-guided drainage offers an effective means of breathlessness control without the burden and costs of daily drainages. A recent randomised study found that talc pleurodesis can be administered via indwelling pleural catheter and enhance pleurodesis and catheter removal rate. Combining this approach with aggressive daily drainage after talc instillation to enhance the rate of successful pleurodesis should be assessed.\na malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion. All patients had malignant cells identified in the pleural fluid or pleural biopsy tissue; or a large exudative pleural e/uniFB00usion without other causes in a patient with known disseminated extrapleural malignancy. Exclusion criteria were age younger than 18 years, expected survival less than 3 months, pleural infection, chylothorax, pregnancy, lactation, uncorrectable bleeding diathesis, previous ipsilateral lobectomy or pneumonectomy, significant loculations likely to preclude e/uniFB00ective fluid drainage, significant visual impairment, and inability to consent or comply with the study protocol.\n\n## andomisation and masking\n\nRandomisation was done independently by the National Health & Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Clinical Trials Centre, University of Sydney, Australia. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to aggressive (daily) or symptom\u00adguided drainage via their indwelling pleural catheter, by use of an automated telephone\u00adbased voice\u00ad response randomisation service. Randomisation code generation was assigned sequentially as patients under\u00ad went the randomisation process. Randomisation was minimised for cancer type (mesothelioma vs non\u00ad mesothelioma), performance status (Eastern Co operative Oncology Group [ECOG] score 0-1 vs \u22652), presence of trapped lung ( vs its absence), and prior pleurodesis ( vs no prior pleurodesis). Trapped lung was defined as air or fluid in the pleural space occupying 25% or more of the lateral chest wall after initial drainage. Minimisation is a dynamic method; as such, there was no sequence generation. Allocation concealment was ad ditionally maintained by incorporating an imbalance window (set at 3) within which treatments were completely random (the order of the random allocations was maintained within the NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre secure database). Patients who withdrew from the trial were not replaced. Masking of patients or those giving the interventions was not practical or possible.\n\n## rocedures\n\nThe indwelling pleural catheter (Rocket Medical plc, Washington, UK) was inserted as per standard clinical practice. Patients were randomly assigned within 72 h of indwelling pleural catheter insertion after maximum pleural fluid evacuation to ensure the same baseline for all patients. In the aggressive drainage group, patients (or their carers or community nurses) were asked to drain the malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion via the in dwelling pleural catheter every day for the first 60 days unless clinically contraindicated, or unless spontaneous pleurodesis had occurred. For the symptom\u00adguided group, patients carried out drainage when they had e/uniFB00usion\u00adrelated symptoms (usually breathlessness, cough, or chest tightness). The indwelling pleural catheter was accessed at least fortnightly to ensure it remained patent and to assess whether fluid was still being produced.\nPatients were supplied with standard indwelling pleural catheter vacuum\u00adsuction bottles (600 mL) for fluid drainage, following instructions of the manufact\u00ad urer. Pleurodesis was defined as less than 50 mL of fluid removed at three consecutive drainages 6 (in the aggressive drainage group) or at two attempts 2 weeks apart (in the symptom\u00adguided group), and in the absence of substantial residual pleural fluid collections on imaging.\nAll patients and carers were given a standard briefing about the drainage method, aftercare, and potential complications, and had ready access to support services (eg, via direct phone line) for any concerns. They were free to receive other treatments including chemo\u00ad irradiation and palliative care as recommended by treating clinicians. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 6 months after randomisation or until death, whichever occurred first. The drainage regimen after 60 days was left to the discretion of the attending clinicians.\nPatients kept a logbook of their breathlessness score recorded every day for 60 days and then weekly until the end of the study. The breathlessness score was measured by use of a validated 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), a 100 mm line anchored with 'best breathing' at 0 mm and 'worst breathing imaginable' at 100 mm. The pain level was also measured on a 100 mm VAS, which was anchored with 'no pain' at 0 mm and 'worst imaginable pain' at 100 mm. 8 The volume of pleural fluid removed at each drainage was also recorded.\nBaseline clinical data, VAS scores for breathlessness 4,5,9 and pain, and quality\u00adof\u00adlife measures (VAS and EuroQoL\u00ad5 Dimensions\u00ad5 Levels [EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L] 10 ) were collected before indwelling pleural catheter insertion and after randomisation (within 72 h after insertion). Patients were followed up at 2 weeks and 4 weeks, and thereafter monthly for 6 months. Details of any hospital admissions were recorded, including duration, adverse events, and clinical management.\n\n## utcomes\n\nThe primary outcome was the mean daily breathlessness score in the first 60 days after randomisation. The VAS scores were measured by two independent assessors and the average of their readings recorded. Both assess\u00ad ors repeated their measurements separately if initial readings di/uniFB00ered by more than 3 mm. If discrepancies persisted, the assessors would re\u00adscore and discuss to reach a consensus.\nSecondary outcomes included rates of spontaneous pleurodesis and self\u00adreported global quality\u00adof\u00adlife measurements with two instruments, namely the EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L 11,12 and a 100 mm VAS at randomisation (after maximal fluid drainage), at pre\u00addetermined clinic follow\u00adup visits 2 weeks and 4 weeks after random\u00ad isation, and thereafter monthly for up to 6 months. The EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L score consisted of five domains: mobility,\nself\u00adcare, usual activities, discomfort or pain, and anxiety or depression. Each domain was graded by the patient from 1 (no problems) to 5 (worst). The quality\u00ad of\u00adlife score was also measured with a 100 mm line anchored with 'best quality of life' at 0 mm and 'worst\nquality of life' at 100 mm. Another secondary outcome was the total number of episodes and duration of hospital stay for any cause (excluding elective ad\u00ad missions for chemotherapy). Hospital admissions were subdivided into pleural\u00adrelated (or not) hospital days, as defined previously, 4 from randomisation to death or end of 6\u00admonth follow\u00adup, whichever occurred first. Other secondary outcomes were the frequency of adverse events and serious adverse events, which were assessed by an independent reviewer for relatedness to the trial intervention, and survival.\n\n## tatistical analysis\n\nData were analysed on an intention\u00adto\u00adtreat basis and supporting analyses were done adjusting for minimisation variables measured at randomisation of mesothelioma, ECOG score, the presence of a trapped lung, and prior pleurodesis, in addition to the random e/uniFB00ect of study centre, where appropriate. All data were analysed with the R environment for statistical computing 13 and SAS/STAT software, version 9.4.\nThe study was designed to enrol at least 86 patients to detect a mean di/uniFB00erence in VAS score of 14 mm between the treatment groups (5% significance, 90% power) assuming a common between\u00adgroup SD of 18\u00b79 mm (based on a previous randomised controlled trial of treatment with an indwelling pleural catheter 5 ) and a 10% lost\u00adto\u00adfollow\u00adup rate. The minimal clinically important di/uniFB00erence for the VAS score in this setting was 19 mm (95% CI 14-24) as per the study by Mishra and colleagues. 9 The lower end of the 95% CI of 14 mm was used for this power calculation.\nThe di/uniFB00erence in breathlessness scores and pain scores between the two groups was analysed with a two\u00adsample t test on the log\u00adtransformed average scores in the first 60 days of the trial. Results are back\u00ad transformed and presented as geometric means and 95% CIs and compared through a ratio of the geometric means. A two\u00adsample t test was used to compare the di/uniFB00erence in rates of logbook completion between the two groups.\nTime to spontaneous pleurodesis was analysed with the Fine and Gray competing risks survival model, with competing risk being death, and described with the cumulative incidence curve. Time to death was analysed with Kaplan\u00adMeier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models. For all time\u00adto\u00adevent analyses, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs comparing the two groups are provided. Di/uniFB00erences in proportions of survival and spontaneous pleurodesis between the groups were compared with \u03c72 tests for independence or Fisher's exact tests. All hospital admissions data were analysed with Mann\u00adWhitney tests to compare the two groups with supporting analyses by use of negative binomial regression models. The EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L 11,12 scores were converted into a single index value that generates a measure of utility ranging from -0\u00b7111 to 1\u00b7000 (where\nData are median (IQR), n (%), or mean (SD).

Fixed e/uniFB00ects of treatment, time, and the treatment by time interaction and random patient and study centre e/uniFB00ects were included in the model along with e/uniFB00ects of minimisation variables and, in supporting analyses, the e/uniFB00ect of baseline index values.

The groups were well matched for age, sex, proportions of primary malignancies and trapped lung, e/uniFB00usion size, comorbidities, baseline symptom scores, and ECOG status (Table 1). The most common underlying malignancies were lung cancer (n=34), mesothelioma (n=29), and ovarian carcinoma (n=10).\nThose randomly assigned to the aggressive group underwent 1420 drainages (median 39 [IQR 13-57] per participant) for up to 60 days (the intervention period), until time of pleurodesis or death (whichever occurred earliest), of a possible 1518 drainages, confirming good compliance. Patients in the symptom\u00adguided group underwent 535 drainages (median 11 [IQR 7-18] per participant) in the same period. At the end of the 6\u00admonth follow\u00adup period, the total number of drainages done was 1999 in the aggressive drainage group and 1035 in the symptom\u00adguided group.\nData were analysed on an intention\u00adto\u00adtreat basis (Figure 1). Five patients did not return their logbook and therefore had no breathlessness score data; they were excluded from the primary endpoint analysis. Compliance rates of reporting daily breathlessness scores\ndid not di/uniFB00er significantly between the two groups (81\u00b78% in the aggressive drainage group vs 79\u00b77% in the symptom\u00adguided group, p=0\u00b774).\n\n## igure 1: Trial profile\n\nThe minimal clinically important difference of this instrument is 19 mm for patients with malignant pleural effusion.

This outcome was further supported in analyses adjusting for minimisation variables and including random centre e/uniFB00ects (geometric mean 16\u00b73 mm [95% CI 11\u00b73-23\u00b77] with aggressive drainage vs 21\u00b70 mm [14\u00b78-29\u00b77] with symptom\u00adguided drainage, p=0\u00b721; ratio of geometric means 1\u00b728 [95% CI 0\u00b786-1\u00b791]) and was consistent when multiple imputation was done to account for missing logbook entries.\nThe frequency of spontaneous pleurodesis was sig\u00ad nificantly higher in the aggressive drainage group (16 [37\u00b72%] of 43 patients) than in the symptom\u00adguided group in the first 60 days (five [11\u00b74%] of 44; p=0\u00b70049), and after 6 months (19 [44\u00b72%] vs seven [15\u00b79%], p=0\u00b7004). The competing risk survival model indicated\nhigher likelihood of development of spontaneous pleurodesis in the aggressive drainage group than in the symptom\u00adguided group (Hazard ratio (HR) 3\u00b7287, 95% CI 1\u00b7396-7\u00b7740; p=0\u00b70065; Figure 3). These results were consistent after adjusting for minimisation variables (Hazard ratio (HR) 3\u00b7429 [95% CI 1\u00b7413-8\u00b7320]; p=0\u00b70064).\nWe compared patients with non\u00adtrapped (n=59) and trapped lungs (n=28) in a post\u00adhoc analysis. Spontaneous pleurodesis was more common in those with non\u00ad trapped lungs than in those with trapped lungs (17 [28\u00b78%] vs four [14\u00b73%]) at 60 days but not at 6 months (18 [30\u00b75%] vs eight [28\u00b76%]). In the aggressive drainage group, spontaneous pleurodesis developed in 12 (41\u00b74%) patients with non\u00adtrapped lungs compared with four (28\u00b76%) with trapped lungs at 60 days and in 12 (41\u00b74%) compared with seven (50\u00b70%) at 6 months. In the symptom\u00adguided group, spontaneous pleurodesis developed in five (16\u00b77%) patients with non\u00adtrapped lungs, compared with none in those with trapped lungs at 60 days and in six (20\u00b70%) compared with one (7\u00b71%) at 6 months. The Kaplan\u00adMeier estimated median time to pleurodesis was 121 days in the aggressive drainage group, including in those with trapped and non\u00adtrapped lungs. The success rate was too low in the symptom\u00ad guided group to provide a reliable Kaplan\u00adMeier estimate of the median time to pleurodesis.\nThe mean VAS pain score during the first 60 days of the trial was 10\u00b774 mm (SD 12\u00b780) in the aggressive drainage group and 16\u00b731 mm (16\u00b758) in the symptom\u00ad guided group (Figure 4), with no significant di/uniFB00erence between the groups (ratio of geometric means 1\u00b728 [95% CI 0\u00b776-2\u00b718], p=0\u00b735).\nIn a linear mixed model of response to EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L, no interaction between time and treatment was detected, and patient\u00adreported quality\u00adof\u00adlife measures over the study period and follow\u00adup visits were better in the aggressive drainage group than in the symptom\u00adguided drainage group (estimated means 0\u00b7713 [95% CI 0\u00b7647-0\u00b7779] vs 0\u00b7601 [0\u00b7536-0\u00b7667]). The estimated di/uniFB00erence in means was 0\u00b7112 (95% CI 0\u00b70198-0\u00b7204; p=0\u00b70174). This finding was consistent after adjusting for minimisation variables and baseline EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L index values (estimated di/uniFB00erence in means 0\u00b7097 [95% CI 0\u00b7004-0\u00b7191], p=0\u00b70408). No between\u00adgroup di/uniFB00erences were found in the VAS quality\u00adof\u00adlife scores during the study visits (ratio of geometric means 1\u00b7220 [95% CI 0\u00b7871-1\u00b7709], p=0\u00b725). For all visit times for both groups there was concordance in the measures of EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L and the VAS quality\u00adof\u00adlife score with significant correlations at most visit times and moderate to high correlations throughout (appendix).\nThe median number of hospital admissions for the entire cohort was one [IQR 0-2] for the first 60 days and two [1-3] at 6 months. Overall, patients spent 1 day [IQR 0-8] in total in hospital by 60 days and 5 days [0-15] by 6 months. The number of hospital admissions or duration spent in hospital (either in total number of days\nThree patients withdrew from the study during the 6-month follow-up: one from the aggressive drainage group at 173 days and two from the symptom-guided drainage group at 52 and 97 days. Hazard ratio (HR)=hazard ratio.\nSee Online for appendix\nor when only the e/uniFB00usion\u00adrelated admissions were included (as defined in our previous trial 4 ) did not di/uniFB00er significantly between the two groups (Table 2). These results were consistent after adjusting for days enrolled in the trial and other minimisation variables.\nPatients with better ECOG performance status (score 0-1) spent fewer e/uniFB00usion\u00adrelated days in hospital at 60 days (1 [IQR 0-2] vs 2 [0-6] days, p=0\u00b70392) and by 6 months (1 [IQR 0-4] vs 2 [0-6] days, p=0\u00b70339) than did those with ECOG performance status scores of 2 or greater. Trapped lung at baseline was associated with fewer episodes of hospital admissions (one [IQR 0-2] vs two [1-3] without trapped lung, p=0\u00b70406), as well as total (2\u00b75 [IQR 0\u00b70-6\u00b70] vs 6\u00b70 [1\u00b70-19\u00b70], p=0\u00b70013) and e/uniFB00usion\u00adrelated days spent in hospital (1 [IQR 0-3] vs 1 [0-6] day, p=0\u00b70158) at 6 months.\nTime to death at 6 months did not di/uniFB00er significantly between the aggressive drainage and symptom\u00adguided drainage groups (Hazard ratio (HR) 0\u00b7951 [95% CI 0\u00b7499-1\u00b7812]; p=0\u00b788; Figure 5). In the first 60 days, ten (23\u00b73%) patients in the aggressive drainage group and nine (20\u00b75%) in the symptom\u00adguided drainage group died (estimated di/uniFB00erence in proportions 0\u00b7028, 95% CI -0\u00b7146 to 0\u00b7202, p=0\u00b775). By 6 months, 18 (41\u00b79%) patients in the aggressive drainage group and 19 (43\u00b72%) in the symptom\u00adguided drainage group had died (estimated di/uniFB00erence in proportions -0\u00b7013, 95% CI -0\u00b7221 to 0\u00b7195, p=0\u00b790).\nPatients with better performance status by ECOG score also had longer survival (Hazard ratio (HR) 0\u00b7399 [95% CI 0\u00b7203-0\u00b7785] for death [ for better to poorer ECOG status], p=0\u00b70078) at 6 months.\nThe total numbers and proportions of patients with one or more adverse event or serious adverse event are presented in Table 3. Of the 32 serious adverse events and 46 adverse events recorded, 11 (four serious adverse events and seven adverse events) were deemed definitely not related to the trial intervention by an independent assessor. 11 patients in the aggressive drainage group and 12 in the symptom\u00adguided drainage group had serious adverse events. Adverse events occurred in 13 patients in the aggressive drainage group and in 22 in the symptom\u00adguided drainage group. In the symptom\u00adguided group, the most common adverse event was pain at the indwelling pleural catheter site requiring narcotics (n=12). Worsening dyspnoea due to ipsilateral pleural e/uniFB00usion despite drainage occurred in six patients, which usually responded well to increasing drainage frequency.\n11 episodes of pleural infection developed (five in the aggressive drainage group and six in the symp t om\u00adguided drainage group) in nine patients over 6 months. Four patients had their indwelling pleural catheter removed at the time of infection and three others developed pleurodesis after infection. There were no deaths related to indwelling pleural catheter infection.\n\n## iscussion\n\nThis multicentre randomised controlled trial showed no di/uniFB00erences between the aggressive (daily) and the symptom\u00adguided drainage approaches in providing breathlessness control over the first 60 days after indwelling pleural catheter insertion. There were no significant between\u00adgroup di/uniFB00erences in pain, days spent in hospital, or survival. Aggressive drainage was associated with a higher rate of pleurodesis and better EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L index values than symptom\u00adguided drainage. Serious adverse events were uncommon in either group.\nMalignant pleural e/uniFB00usions are common and a/uniFB00ect about a third of patients with lung and breast cancers and the majority of patients with mesothelioma. Malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion often heralds incurable cancers and limited prognosis. 18 Control of the associated breathlessness frequently requires invasive pleural procedures. Use of an indwelling pleural catheter presents an alternative to conventional talc pleurodesis, and has been shown to reduce days spent in hospital, 5,19 and the need for repeat\nTable 2: Data of hospital admissions in episodes and duration by treatment groups\nHazard ratio (HR)=hazard ratio.\npleural interventions in the patient's remaining life\u00ad span. 4,5 The use of indwelling pleural catheters is growing rapidly, especially in developed countries, and is often advocated as the first\u00adline definitive therapy for malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion. 20 Ambulatory indwelling pleural catheter drainages do require resources (time of carers and/or community nurses, and consumables) and can theoretic\u00ad ally intro duce infections. 21 Two approaches to indwelling pleural catheter management-aggressive and symptom\u00ad guided drainage-have evolved and are at equipoise.\nOur study found no significant di/uniFB00erences in breathlessness control, the principal goal of malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion palliation, whether the patients did drainages daily or as guided by symptoms. These data are reassuring and imply that, if assigned to do so, patients were able to recognise early, or anticipate, their symptoms and perform drainages before any discomfort reached a level of impact.\nHowever, aggressive daily fluid removal did promote more e/uniFB00ective pleurodesis. Keeping the pleural cavity fluid\u00adfree theoretically allows better approximation of the visceral and parietal pleura and thus adhesion formation and pleural symphysis. Conversely, permit\u00ad ting asymptomatic accumulation of the pleural fluid in between symptom\u00adguided drainages might have physically impaired pleural symphysis. A previous randomised controlled trial also found that spontaneous pleurodesis occurred more commonly with daily rather than alternate\u00adday drainages. 6\nSpontaneous pleurodesis in the aggressive drainage group mostly developed within the first 60 days, consistent with the timeframe from published data. 6,17 In our protocol, the drainage schedules after 60 days were left to the choice of the attending clinicians and patients. Without the suggestion of slowing down drainage, many patients might have adopted a less aggressive approach. Whether prolonging daily drainage beyond 60 days will facilitate late pleurodesis requires further research.\nOur study is one of the very few randomised controlled trials that included patients with a trapped lung, which accounted for a third of the cohort, consistent with commonly quoted data. Those with trapped lung had (expectedly) a lower rate of pleurodesis than did those with an expandable lung, though aggressive drainage was still associated with a higher pleurodesis rate even in the trapped lung group. The exact mechanism will need exploration, although it is possible that in some cases the trapped lung can slowly expand with time, concurrent therapy, or a combination of both, and allow pleural symphysis. Alternatively, the trapped space might be small and when sufficient adhesions or loculations develop over time, no further fluid drainage is necessary. Nonetheless, future studies should incorporate patients with trapped lung to guide best care.\nReassuringly, aggressive drainage was not associated with more pain or infection than that observed with symptom\u00adguided drainage. Pleural infection related to an indwelling pleural catheter a/uniFB00ected about 5% of patients in our previous international study. 22 Daily access of the catheter might increase the risks of introducing microbes; however, pleural drainage is the key to empyema management, and aggressive drainage might ensure prompt removal of any microbes that have entered the pleural cavity. There were also no major di/uniFB00erences in the frequency of other serious adverse events or survival between the two groups. More adverse events were observed in the symptom\u00adguided drainage group, especially dyspnoea attributed to pleural e/uniFB00usion, most of which responded to increased frequency of drainage.\nPatients in the aggressive drainage group reported better EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L index values, despite no clear benefits in their reported breathlessness or pain scores. There is no minimal clinically important di/uniFB00erence specifically\nassigned for patients with malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion for EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L or VAS quality\u00adof\u00adlife scores. In our study, the between\u00adgroup di/uniFB00erence of the EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L index value was 0\u00b7112, which is above the minimal clinically important di/uniFB00erence of 0\u00b709 defined by Pickard and colleagues 23 in patients with advanced cancers. Daily removal of the fluid might have provided benefits in symptoms not captured with our breathlessness and pain measurements. The higher pleurodesis rate, with resultant freedom from fluid (and symptom) recurrence and of the catheter, might have contributed to the better reported quality of life. Additionally, it has been suggested that indwelling pleural catheter drainage gives patients an important sense of control when they are feeling helpless with their advancing cancer. Whether this e/uniFB00ect can explain the scores observed in our study remains to be tested. The two quality\u00adof\u00adlife instruments both showed improvements and good correlations of the values between the EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L and VAS quality\u00adof\u00adlife scores at each time point. The between\u00adgroup di/uniFB00erences were significant with EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L but not with VAS quality\u00adof\u00adlife scores. This di/uniFB00erence might be related to the sensitivity of the instruments in detecting changes in this patient population, but this is a topic for future studies.\nDeveloping the full potential of indwelling pleural catheters in malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion care is a topic of active research. Combining an indwelling pleural catheter with pleurodesis, either by instillation 17 via the catheter or coating 24 of the catheter with a pleurodesing agent, appears promising. Defining the best drainage regimen will hold an even more important role if instillation of pleurodesing agents becomes routine practice. A randomised trial 17 showed that instillation of talc slurry (followed by indwelling pleural catheter drainage two to three times a week) induced a higher rate of pleurodesis than saline control. However, the success rate in the talc group was low (around 43%), similar to what was achieved with aggressive drainage (without talc) in our trial. The results of our trial and the ASAP study 6 both confirm that daily indwelling pleural catheter fluid removal enhances spontaneous pleurodesis, which is adopted now into protocols of ongoing studies (eg, EPIToME and OPTIMUM 25 ) evaluating talc instillation via indwelling pleural catheter.\nOur study has various limitations. First, the primary endpoint was set at 60 days as this reflects the short median survival of patients with malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion from lung cancers (the most common type of malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion globally). We did, however, also include many patients with malignant pleural e/uniFB00usions from mesothelioma (the subtype with longest median survival among common causes of malignant pleural e/uniFB00usions). Our results did not di/uniFB00er between patients with non\u00admesothelioma and those with mesothelioma. Second, the definition of spontaneous pleurodesis used in the published literature describes\ncessation of fluid formation, which might relate to treatment or the natural disease course, but not necessarily to symphysis of the visceral and parietal pleura (the true meaning of pleurodesis). Ultrasound assessment was available in a subset of 18 patients who had spontaneous pleurodesis in the lead centre; all but one achieved sonographic appearances of pleural symphysis. Third, the consumable and carer costs of daily drainage vary substantially around the world. However, this study has provided an approximation of the amount of drainage consumables needed for aggressive and symptom\u00adguided drainage, which would allow clinicians to estimate local costs of each regimen. Fourth, as our study was an open label study, the use of patient\u00adreported measures could potentially contain bias.\nData from recently published randomised controlled trials in malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion manage ment support the use of an indwelling pleural catheter as first\u00adchoice definitive management in patients with malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion, 4,5,26,27 but the optimal drainage schedule must be identified to realise the full potential of this intervention. The AMPLE\u00ad2 trial showed that either aggressive or symptom\u00adguided drainage regimens are adequate in providing breathlessness control. However, daily fluid removal enhances spontaneous pleurodesis and might improve quality of life without any drawbacks in relation to pain, infection rates, or survival. In patients in whom pleurodesis is an important goal (eg, those undertaking strategies involving an indwelling pleural catheter plus pleurodesing agents), aggressive drainage should be done for at least 60 days. Future studies will need to establish if more aggressive (eg, twice daily) regimens for the initial phase could further enhance success rates. 28 However, for patients whose primary care aim is palliation (eg, those with very limited life expectancy or significant trapped lung where pleurodesis is unlikely), our data show that symptom\u00adguided drainage o/uniFB00ers an e/uniFB00ective means of breathlessness control without the inconvenience and costs of daily drainages. The ability to predict the likelihood of pleurodesis will help guide the choice of regimen and should be a topic of future studies.\n\n## ontributors\n\nYCGL was the guarantor of this Article.

      "content": "Background Indwelling pleural catheters are an established management option for malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion and have advantages over talc slurry pleurodesis. The optimal regimen of drainage after indwelling pleural catheter insertion is debated and ranges from aggressive (daily) drainage to drainage only when symptomatic.\nMethods AMPLE-2 was an open-label randomised trial involving 11 centres in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. Patients with symptomatic malignant pleural e/uniFB00usions were randomly assigned (1:1) to the aggressive (daily) or symptom-guided drainage groups for 60 days and minimised by cancer type (mesothelioma vs others), performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] score 0-1 vs \u22652), presence of trapped lung, and prior pleurodesis. Patients were followed up for 6 months. The primary outcome was mean daily breathlessness score, measured by use of a 100 mm visual analogue scale during the first 60 days. Secondary outcomes included rates of spontaneous pleurodesis and self-reported quality-of-life measures. Results were analysed by an intention-totreat approach. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12615000963527.\nFindings Between July 20, 2015, and Jan 26, 2017, 87 patients were recruited and randomly assigned to the aggressive (n=43) or symptom-guided (n=44) drainage groups. The mean daily breathlessness scores did not di/uniFB00er significantly between the aggressive and symptom-guided drainage groups (geometric means 13 \u00b7 1 mm [95% CI 9\u00b78-17\u00b74] vs 17\u00b73 mm [13\u00b70-22\u00b70]; ratio of geometric means 1\u00b732 [95% CI 0\u00b788-1\u00b797]; p=0\u00b718). More patients in the aggressive group developed spontaneous pleurodesis than in the symptom-guided group in the first 60 days (16 [37\u00b72%] of 43 vs five [11\u00b74%] of 44, p=0\u00b70049) and at 6 months (19 [44\u00b72%] vs seven [15\u00b79%], p=0\u00b7004; hazard ratio 3\u00b7287 [95% CI 1\u00b7396-7\u00b7740]; p=0\u00b70065). Patient-reported quality-of-life measures, assessed with EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), were better in the aggressive group than in the symptom-guided group (estimated means 0\u00b7713 [95% CI 0\u00b7647-0\u00b7779] vs 0\u00b7601 [0\u00b7536-0\u00b7667]). The estimated di/uniFB00erence in means was 0\u00b7112 (95% CI 0\u00b70198-0\u00b7204; p=0\u00b70174). Pain scores, total days spent in hospital, and mortality did not di/uniFB00er significantly between groups. Serious adverse events occurred in 11 (25\u00b76%) of 43 patients in the aggressive drainage group and in 12 (27\u00b73%) of 44 patients in the symptom-guided drainage group, including 11 episodes of pleural infection in nine patients (five in the aggressive group and six in the symptom-guided drainage group).\nInterpretation We found no di/uniFB00erences between the aggressive (daily) and the symptom-guided drainage regimens for indwelling pleural catheters in providing breathlessness control. These data indicate that daily indwelling pleural catheter drainage is more e/uniFB00ective in promoting spontaneous pleurodesis and might improve quality of life.\nFunding Cancer Council of Western Australia and the Sir Charles Gairdner Research Advisory Group.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Few data exist to guide drainage approaches for patients with an indwelling pleural catheter. Practices vary worldwide, ranging from aggressive (daily or alternate\u00adday) drainage, often used in centres in the USA, 6 to drainage only when symptoms develop, which is common in the rest of the world. These di/uniFB00erences in practice could potentially influence outcomes and complication rates.\nAggressive daily drainage arguably keeps the pleural space dry and provides best symptom control every day, whereas health\u00adcare practitioners who advocate symptom\u00ad guided drainage contend that the goal of malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion care is palliation and that drainage of indwelling pleural catheter is only indicated when symptoms arise. The symptom\u00adguided approach might reduce a substantial amount of burden and consumable costs compared with daily drainage, and might reduce the risk of iatrogenic introduction of pleural infection.\nConversely, frequent indwelling pleural catheter drainage might facilitate approximation of the visceral and parietal pleura and facilitate their symphysis (so\u00adcalled spontaneous pleurodesis), and allow removal of the catheter. Daily drainage has been shown to promote pleurodesis more e/uniFB00ectively than alternate\u00adday drainage. 6 Whether a symptom\u00adguided approach a/uniFB00ects the rate of pleurodesis is unknown.\nThe Australasian Malignant PLeural E/uniFB00usion\u00ad2 (AMPLE\u00ad2) study was designed to address the equipoise between aggressive (daily) versus symptom\u00adguided approaches to indwelling pleural catheter drainage in patients with a malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion-specifically, their efficacy in breathlessness control, induction of pleurodesis, improvement of quality of life, reduction of days spent in hospital, and complication rates. 7",

Results of two multicentre trials have confirmed that an indwelling pleural catheter provides similar benefits to conventional talc slurry pleurodesis with regard to symptom control and quality of life. The AMPLE-1 randomised trial found that an indwelling pleural catheter provided added advantages over talc pleurodesis in reducing days spent in hospital, in patients' remaining lifespan, and in minimising the need for repeat invasive pleural drainage procedures. Having established the advantages and safety of indwelling pleural catheter insertion for management of malignant pleural effusions, the next step was to optimise its effectiveness by identifying its best drainage regimen. We searched PubMed for articles published before March 1, 2018, using the terms 'malignant pleural effusion' AND 'indwelling pleural catheter OR IPC' AND 'drainage frequency' AND 'breathlessness OR dyspnoea'. The only randomised controlled trial in the 11 articles found compared rates of spontaneous pleurodesis between daily drainage versus alternate-day drainage in 149 patients with malignant pleural effusions. However, many clinicians preferred drainage only when patients developed symptomatic breathlessness, as malignant pleural effusion management is mainly palliative. Aggressive (daily) versus infrequent symptom-guided drainage regimens have not been compared but have substantial implications for clinical care.",

For patients whose primary care aim is palliation, our data suggest that symptom-guided drainage offers an effective means of breathlessness control without the burden and costs of daily drainages. A recent randomised study found that talc pleurodesis can be administered via indwelling pleural catheter and enhance pleurodesis and catheter removal rate. Combining this approach with aggressive daily drainage after talc instillation to enhance the rate of successful pleurodesis should be assessed.\na malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion.

Patients were randomly assigned within 72 h of indwelling pleural catheter insertion after maximum pleural fluid evacuation to ensure the same baseline for all patients. In the aggressive drainage group, patients (or their carers or community nurses) were asked to drain the malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion via the in dwelling pleural catheter every day for the first 60 days unless clinically contraindicated, or unless spontaneous pleurodesis had occurred. For the symptom\u00adguided group, patients carried out drainage when they had e/uniFB00usion\u00adrelated symptoms (usually breathlessness, cough, or chest tightness). The indwelling pleural catheter was accessed at least fortnightly to ensure it remained patent and to assess whether fluid was still being produced.\nPatients were supplied with standard indwelling pleural catheter vacuum\u00adsuction bottles (600 mL) for fluid drainage, following instructions of the manufact\u00ad urer. Pleurodesis was defined as less than 50 mL of fluid removed at three consecutive drainages 6 (in the aggressive drainage group) or at two attempts 2 weeks apart (in the symptom\u00adguided group), and in the absence of substantial residual pleural fluid collections on imaging.\nAll patients and carers were given a standard briefing about the drainage method, aftercare, and potential complications, and had ready access to support services (eg, via direct phone line) for any concerns. They were free to receive other treatments including chemo\u00ad irradiation and palliative care as recommended by treating clinicians. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 6 months after randomisation or until death, whichever occurred first. The drainage regimen after 60 days was left to the discretion of the attending clinicians.\nPatients kept a logbook of their breathlessness score recorded every day for 60 days and then weekly until the end of the study. The breathlessness score was measured by use of a validated 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), a 100 mm line anchored with 'best breathing' at 0 mm and 'worst breathing imaginable' at 100 mm. The pain level was also measured on a 100 mm VAS, which was anchored with 'no pain' at 0 mm and 'worst imaginable pain' at 100 mm. 8 The volume of pleural fluid removed at each drainage was also recorded.\nBaseline clinical data, VAS scores for breathlessness 4,5,9 and pain, and quality\u00adof\u00adlife measures (VAS and EuroQoL\u00ad5 Dimensions\u00ad5 Levels [EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L] 10 ) were collected before indwelling pleural catheter insertion and after randomisation (within 72 h after insertion).

If discrepancies persisted, the assessors would re\u00adscore and discuss to reach a consensus.\nSecondary outcomes included rates of spontaneous pleurodesis and self\u00adreported global quality\u00adof\u00adlife measurements with two instruments, namely the EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L 11,12 and a 100 mm VAS at randomisation (after maximal fluid drainage), at pre\u00addetermined clinic follow\u00adup visits 2 weeks and 4 weeks after random\u00ad isation, and thereafter monthly for up to 6 months. The EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L score consisted of five domains: mobility,\nself\u00adcare, usual activities, discomfort or pain, and anxiety or depression. Each domain was graded by the patient from 1 (no problems) to 5 (worst). The quality\u00ad of\u00adlife score was also measured with a 100 mm line anchored with 'best quality of life' at 0 mm and 'worst\nquality of life' at 100 mm. Another secondary outcome was the total number of episodes and duration of hospital stay for any cause (excluding elective ad\u00ad missions for chemotherapy). Hospital admissions were subdivided into pleural\u00adrelated (or not) hospital days, as defined previously, 4 from randomisation to death or end of 6\u00admonth follow\u00adup, whichever occurred first. Other secondary outcomes were the frequency of adverse events and serious adverse events, which were assessed by an independent reviewer for relatedness to the trial intervention, and survival.",

The groups were well matched for age, sex, proportions of primary malignancies and trapped lung, e/uniFB00usion size, comorbidities, baseline symptom scores, and ECOG status (Table 1). The most common underlying malignancies were lung cancer (n=34), mesothelioma (n=29), and ovarian carcinoma (n=10).\nThose randomly assigned to the aggressive group underwent 1420 drainages (median 39 [IQR 13-57] per participant) for up to 60 days (the intervention period), until time of pleurodesis or death (whichever occurred earliest), of a possible 1518 drainages, confirming good compliance.

Spontaneous pleurodesis was more common in those with non\u00ad trapped lungs than in those with trapped lungs (17 [28\u00b78%] vs four [14\u00b73%]) at 60 days but not at 6 months (18 [30\u00b75%] vs eight [28\u00b76%]). In the aggressive drainage group, spontaneous pleurodesis developed in 12 (41\u00b74%) patients with non\u00adtrapped lungs compared with four (28\u00b76%) with trapped lungs at 60 days and in 12 (41\u00b74%) compared with seven (50\u00b70%) at 6 months. In the symptom\u00adguided group, spontaneous pleurodesis developed in five (16\u00b77%) patients with non\u00adtrapped lungs, compared with none in those with trapped lungs at 60 days and in six (20\u00b70%) compared with one (7\u00b71%) at 6 months. The Kaplan\u00adMeier estimated median time to pleurodesis was 121 days in the aggressive drainage group, including in those with trapped and non\u00adtrapped lungs. The success rate was too low in the symptom\u00ad guided group to provide a reliable Kaplan\u00adMeier estimate of the median time to pleurodesis.\nThe mean VAS pain score during the first 60 days of the trial was 10\u00b774 mm (SD 12\u00b780) in the aggressive drainage group and 16\u00b731 mm (16\u00b758) in the symptom\u00ad guided group (Figure 4), with no significant di/uniFB00erence between the groups (ratio of geometric means 1\u00b728 [95% CI 0\u00b776-2\u00b718], p=0\u00b735).\nIn a linear mixed model of response to EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L, no interaction between time and treatment was detected, and patient\u00adreported quality\u00adof\u00adlife measures over the study period and follow\u00adup visits were better in the aggressive drainage group than in the symptom\u00adguided drainage group (estimated means 0\u00b7713 [95% CI 0\u00b7647-0\u00b7779] vs 0\u00b7601 [0\u00b7536-0\u00b7667]).

In the first 60 days, ten (23\u00b73%) patients in the aggressive drainage group and nine (20\u00b75%) in the symptom\u00adguided drainage group died (estimated di/uniFB00erence in proportions 0\u00b7028, 95% CI -0\u00b7146 to 0\u00b7202, p=0\u00b775). By 6 months, 18 (41\u00b79%) patients in the aggressive drainage group and 19 (43\u00b72%) in the symptom\u00adguided drainage group had died (estimated di/uniFB00erence in proportions -0\u00b7013, 95% CI -0\u00b7221 to 0\u00b7195, p=0\u00b790).\nPatients with better performance status by ECOG score also had longer survival (Hazard ratio (HR) 0\u00b7399 [95% CI 0\u00b7203-0\u00b7785] for death [ for better to poorer ECOG status], p=0\u00b70078) at 6 months.\nThe total numbers and proportions of patients with one or more adverse event or serious adverse event are presented in Table 3. Of the 32 serious adverse events and 46 adverse events recorded, 11 (four serious adverse events and seven adverse events) were deemed definitely not related to the trial intervention by an independent assessor. 11 patients in the aggressive drainage group and 12 in the symptom\u00adguided drainage group had serious adverse events. Adverse events occurred in 13 patients in the aggressive drainage group and in 22 in the symptom\u00adguided drainage group. In the symptom\u00adguided group, the most common adverse event was pain at the indwelling pleural catheter site requiring narcotics (n=12). Worsening dyspnoea due to ipsilateral pleural e/uniFB00usion despite drainage occurred in six patients, which usually responded well to increasing drainage frequency.\n11 episodes of pleural infection developed (five in the aggressive drainage group and six in the symp t om\u00adguided drainage group) in nine patients over 6 months.

      "content": "This multicentre randomised controlled trial showed no di/uniFB00erences between the aggressive (daily) and the symptom\u00adguided drainage approaches in providing breathlessness control over the first 60 days after indwelling pleural catheter insertion. There were no significant between\u00adgroup di/uniFB00erences in pain, days spent in hospital, or survival. Aggressive drainage was associated with a higher rate of pleurodesis and better EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L index values than symptom\u00adguided drainage. Serious adverse events were uncommon in either group.\nMalignant pleural e/uniFB00usions are common and a/uniFB00ect about a third of patients with lung and breast cancers and the majority of patients with mesothelioma. Malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion often heralds incurable cancers and limited prognosis. 18 Control of the associated breathlessness frequently requires invasive pleural procedures. Use of an indwelling pleural catheter presents an alternative to conventional talc pleurodesis, and has been shown to reduce days spent in hospital, 5,19 and the need for repeat\nTable 2: Data of hospital admissions in episodes and duration by treatment groups\nHazard ratio (HR)=hazard ratio.\npleural interventions in the patient's remaining life\u00ad span. 4,5 The use of indwelling pleural catheters is growing rapidly, especially in developed countries, and is often advocated as the first\u00adline definitive therapy for malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion. 20 Ambulatory indwelling pleural catheter drainages do require resources (time of carers and/or community nurses, and consumables) and can theoretic\u00ad ally intro duce infections. 21 Two approaches to indwelling pleural catheter management-aggressive and symptom\u00ad guided drainage-have evolved and are at equipoise.\nOur study found no significant di/uniFB00erences in breathlessness control, the principal goal of malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion palliation, whether the patients did drainages daily or as guided by symptoms. These data are reassuring and imply that, if assigned to do so, patients were able to recognise early, or anticipate, their symptoms and perform drainages before any discomfort reached a level of impact.\nHowever, aggressive daily fluid removal did promote more e/uniFB00ective pleurodesis. Keeping the pleural cavity fluid\u00adfree theoretically allows better approximation of the visceral and parietal pleura and thus adhesion formation and pleural symphysis. Conversely, permit\u00ad ting asymptomatic accumulation of the pleural fluid in between symptom\u00adguided drainages might have physically impaired pleural symphysis. A previous randomised controlled trial also found that spontaneous pleurodesis occurred more commonly with daily rather than alternate\u00adday drainages. 6\nSpontaneous pleurodesis in the aggressive drainage group mostly developed within the first 60 days, consistent with the timeframe from published data. 6,17 In our protocol, the drainage schedules after 60 days were left to the choice of the attending clinicians and patients. Without the suggestion of slowing down drainage, many patients might have adopted a less aggressive approach. Whether prolonging daily drainage beyond 60 days will facilitate late pleurodesis requires further research.\nOur study is one of the very few randomised controlled trials that included patients with a trapped lung, which accounted for a third of the cohort, consistent with commonly quoted data. Those with trapped lung had (expectedly) a lower rate of pleurodesis than did those with an expandable lung, though aggressive drainage was still associated with a higher pleurodesis rate even in the trapped lung group. The exact mechanism will need exploration, although it is possible that in some cases the trapped lung can slowly expand with time, concurrent therapy, or a combination of both, and allow pleural symphysis. Alternatively, the trapped space might be small and when sufficient adhesions or loculations develop over time, no further fluid drainage is necessary. Nonetheless, future studies should incorporate patients with trapped lung to guide best care.\nReassuringly, aggressive drainage was not associated with more pain or infection than that observed with symptom\u00adguided drainage. Pleural infection related to an indwelling pleural catheter a/uniFB00ected about 5% of patients in our previous international study. 22 Daily access of the catheter might increase the risks of introducing microbes; however, pleural drainage is the key to empyema management, and aggressive drainage might ensure prompt removal of any microbes that have entered the pleural cavity. There were also no major di/uniFB00erences in the frequency of other serious adverse events or survival between the two groups. More adverse events were observed in the symptom\u00adguided drainage group, especially dyspnoea attributed to pleural e/uniFB00usion, most of which responded to increased frequency of drainage.\nPatients in the aggressive drainage group reported better EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L index values, despite no clear benefits in their reported breathlessness or pain scores. There is no minimal clinically important di/uniFB00erence specifically\nassigned for patients with malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion for EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L or VAS quality\u00adof\u00adlife scores. In our study, the between\u00adgroup di/uniFB00erence of the EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L index value was 0\u00b7112, which is above the minimal clinically important di/uniFB00erence of 0\u00b709 defined by Pickard and colleagues 23 in patients with advanced cancers. Daily removal of the fluid might have provided benefits in symptoms not captured with our breathlessness and pain measurements. The higher pleurodesis rate, with resultant freedom from fluid (and symptom) recurrence and of the catheter, might have contributed to the better reported quality of life. Additionally, it has been suggested that indwelling pleural catheter drainage gives patients an important sense of control when they are feeling helpless with their advancing cancer. Whether this e/uniFB00ect can explain the scores observed in our study remains to be tested. The two quality\u00adof\u00adlife instruments both showed improvements and good correlations of the values between the EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L and VAS quality\u00adof\u00adlife scores at each time point. The between\u00adgroup di/uniFB00erences were significant with EQ\u00ad5D\u00ad5L but not with VAS quality\u00adof\u00adlife scores. This di/uniFB00erence might be related to the sensitivity of the instruments in detecting changes in this patient population, but this is a topic for future studies.\nDeveloping the full potential of indwelling pleural catheters in malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion care is a topic of active research. Combining an indwelling pleural catheter with pleurodesis, either by instillation 17 via the catheter or coating 24 of the catheter with a pleurodesing agent, appears promising. Defining the best drainage regimen will hold an even more important role if instillation of pleurodesing agents becomes routine practice. A randomised trial 17 showed that instillation of talc slurry (followed by indwelling pleural catheter drainage two to three times a week) induced a higher rate of pleurodesis than saline control. However, the success rate in the talc group was low (around 43%), similar to what was achieved with aggressive drainage (without talc) in our trial. The results of our trial and the ASAP study 6 both confirm that daily indwelling pleural catheter fluid removal enhances spontaneous pleurodesis, which is adopted now into protocols of ongoing studies (eg, EPIToME and OPTIMUM 25 ) evaluating talc instillation via indwelling pleural catheter.\nOur study has various limitations. First, the primary endpoint was set at 60 days as this reflects the short median survival of patients with malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion from lung cancers (the most common type of malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion globally). We did, however, also include many patients with malignant pleural e/uniFB00usions from mesothelioma (the subtype with longest median survival among common causes of malignant pleural e/uniFB00usions). Our results did not di/uniFB00er between patients with non\u00admesothelioma and those with mesothelioma. Second, the definition of spontaneous pleurodesis used in the published literature describes\ncessation of fluid formation, which might relate to treatment or the natural disease course, but not necessarily to symphysis of the visceral and parietal pleura (the true meaning of pleurodesis). Ultrasound assessment was available in a subset of 18 patients who had spontaneous pleurodesis in the lead centre; all but one achieved sonographic appearances of pleural symphysis. Third, the consumable and carer costs of daily drainage vary substantially around the world. However, this study has provided an approximation of the amount of drainage consumables needed for aggressive and symptom\u00adguided drainage, which would allow clinicians to estimate local costs of each regimen. Fourth, as our study was an open label study, the use of patient\u00adreported measures could potentially contain bias.\nData from recently published randomised controlled trials in malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion manage ment support the use of an indwelling pleural catheter as first\u00adchoice definitive management in patients with malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion, 4,5,26,27 but the optimal drainage schedule must be identified to realise the full potential of this intervention. The AMPLE\u00ad2 trial showed that either aggressive or symptom\u00adguided drainage regimens are adequate in providing breathlessness control. However, daily fluid removal enhances spontaneous pleurodesis and might improve quality of life without any drawbacks in relation to pain, infection rates, or survival. In patients in whom pleurodesis is an important goal (eg, those undertaking strategies involving an indwelling pleural catheter plus pleurodesing agents), aggressive drainage should be done for at least 60 days. Future studies will need to establish if more aggressive (eg, twice daily) regimens for the initial phase could further enhance success rates. 28 However, for patients whose primary care aim is palliation (eg, those with very limited life expectancy or significant trapped lung where pleurodesis is unlikely), our data show that symptom\u00adguided drainage o/uniFB00ers an e/uniFB00ective means of breathlessness control without the inconvenience and costs of daily drainages. The ability to predict the likelihood of pleurodesis will help guide the choice of regimen and should be a topic of future studies.",
