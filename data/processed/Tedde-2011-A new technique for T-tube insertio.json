  "abstract": "A silicone T tube is widely used for the management of airway problems. Montgomery described the way in which it is usually inserted, but this conventional insertion technique can fail in cases of subglottic stenosis due to the softness of the T tube, which kinks when forced against resistance.

These modifications use laborious manoeuvres and require the use of rigid bronchoscopy or suspension laryngoscopy. Cooper [2] has used the umbilical tape to place the proximal end of the intraluminal limb in the stenotic subglottic space. This tape is passed through the external limb and proximal end of the T tube, goes through the tracheostoma, and is pulled out by the mouth with a rigid bronchoscope. Shapshay [3] straightened a folded proximal end of the intraluminal limb by pulling with a forceps using a rigid bronchoscope.

Bibas intubated the patient with a cuffed endotracheal tube elongated by an uncuffed tube until this set can be pulled out by the tracheostoma. He inserted the tip of this long tube into the proximal end of the T tube and inflated the cuff so that both tubes become connected and he could pull them together, allowing the proximal end to be inserted inside stenotic subglottic area [5]. There are three advantages with our technique: a T tube can be inserted without the aid of suspension laryngoscopy or rigid bronchoscopy; insufflating the cuff of the Foley catheter helps to adjust the prosthesis in the subglottic stenotic area; and, under direct bronchoscopy, we can view the cuff insufflation which can be repeated as many times as required. Moreover, Foley catheters are ubiquitous, have the required cuff, are not expensive and with their use this technique has good results",

The patient is then submitted to general anaesthesia, usually maintained in spontaneous ventilation. The airway is dilatated with suspension laryngoscopy or rigid bronchoscopy and Montgomery insertion is initiated. When we found difficulties in placing the proximal end, we used the technique as depicted in Figure 1. Using an intubation laryngoscope and a Magill grasper, a 10-F nasogastric tube (NT) is folded and inserted through the mouth and exteriorised by the tracheostoma. It is then introduced through the proximal end of the Montgomery and exteriorised in the extraluminal limb. The folded NT is introduced through the distal perforation of the Foley catheter, creating a large loop which can be passed around the T tube. The NT is then tractioned back in such a way that it becomes firmly attached to the Foley catheter. A forceps grasps the distal end of the Montgomery T tube inserting it into the trachea in the classical manner. Stretching the set NT/Foley catheter helps to introduce the proximal end inside the trachea.
