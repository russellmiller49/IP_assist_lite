Endoscopic application of electrocautery and cryosurgery though effective, may damage the normal adjacent tissue.1The carbon dioxide laser is precise in its soft tissue interaction but lacks an efficient fiber› optic delivery system, and its ability to achieve he› mostasis is limited when compared to the Nd-YAG laser. 2\nAfter animal experiments by Toty et al 3 and others at the end of 1978 the YAG laser was first applied clinically; This led to the beginning of modern endo› scopic tracheobronchial surge~3-12 The growing prob› lem of neoplastic airway obstruction and, to a smaller extent, iatrogenic benign stenoses, provides an oppor› tunity for widespread application of this new technol› ogy; In this article, we will review our clinical experi› ence with laser bronchoscopy during the last five years to reaffirm the application of this new therapy; 13,14\nAlmost all the patients treated had significant symptoms of airway obstruction due to a malignant or benign process. In some patients with lesions such as benign endoluminal tumors, selected carcinoids, early cancers, tracheobronchial granulomas, etc, laser therapy was performed for cure.

The laser used was the Nd:YAG (YM 100 Cilas, Paris) whose technical features are well known, 4 Normallg we used power settings ranging from 40 to 50 W with pulse duration ofO.7-1.2 s. With large tumors we often used longer exposure times (several seconds) at 35 to 40 ~ and with nonmalignant tracheal stenoses, shorter exposure (0.5 s) at 70 to 80 W The ftexible bronchoscope was used alone in 116 (eight percent) treatments, all with patients under local anesthesia. The rigid bronchoscope was used for 1,280 (92 percent) procedures, 1,088 with patients under general and 192 with patient under local anesthesia. The latter mostly refer to our first year of activity when, unlike today anesthetists were not available on a regular basis. We frequently used the rigid bronchoscope to dilate some types of tracheal stenoses and, in polypoid tumors, to scoop out the endoluminal mass, following Dumons technique.8.15 With neoplasms, the laser was used initially to coagulate the mass with low power (25 to 30 W) and long pulse times (5 s~ After mechanical removal of the tumor, the airway wall was photocoagulated for hemostasis. The fiberoptic broncho› scope was used for minor, minimally vascular lesions and, inserted through a rigid bronchoscope, for bronchial lesions that were inaccessible. Survival distribution was estimated by the product› limit method,\" with time computed beginning from the first laser treatment\nFrom April 1982 to July 1987, 1,000 patients were treated with the YAG laser for a total of 1,396 proce› dures performed by the first author only The number of treatments per year increased constantly: 64 in 1982, 205 in 1983, 256 in 1984, 308 in 1985, and 342 in 1986.\nThere were 772 tracheobronchial tumors, 139 non› malignant tracheal stenoses and 89 miscellaneous conditions (Table 1).\nTracheobronchial neoplasms were the most common lesions treated, representing about three quarters of\nbowel, four from the esophagus, two from the breast, one from the thymus, one from the ovary, one from the testicle and one melanoma. Finally there were 34 unclassified tumors.\nResults depended more on the location and macro› scopic appearance of the tumor than on the histologic studies. As to location, trachea and main stem bronchi are the most favorable. Polypoid tumors were readily removed (Figure 1).\nThe immediate results of treating malignant tumors,\nthe total number of patients. We divided them into malignant, uncertain prognosis and benign tumors.\nWetreated 649 malignant tumors in 895 procedures, 41 with the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope alone with patients under local anesthesia and 854 with the rigid bronchoscope (762 were done with patients under general and 92 with patients under local anesthesia) (Table 2). Of the 593 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, 87 were treated two or more times for recurrence. The median time between first and second treatment was III days. Occasionally after laser resec› tion, neoplastic infiltration of the bronchial wall was sometimes seen to be more distal than had originally been thought. This allowed resective surgery in eight cases originally felt to be inoperable, and in another ten patients it allowed less extensive surgery than planned.\nBy far, the most common malignant cell type was squamous cell carcinoma (451, 69.5 percent), followed by adenocarcinomas (48, 7.4 percent), small cell car› cinomas (36, 5.5 percent) and large cell carcinomas (24, 3.7 percent). There also were 19 rare tumors: five carcinosarcomas, five carcinomas in situ , two sarco› mas, two malignant plasmocytomas, one teratoma and four malignant lymphomas (two Hodgkins and two non-Hodgkins). Metastatic tumors included 15 from the thyroid, seven from the kidney, five from the\nalmost always achieved in a single laser session, were invariably good and often spectacular. In the 592 bronchogenic carcinomas alone, we achieved a normal airway lumen gauge or a significant improvement in ventilation in 548 (92.4 percent). In only 45 (7.6 percent) did the laser have no effect; these were mainly obstructions due to external compression or extensive tumor extending distally Histologic tumor cell type had no important bearing on results; normal airway lumen or significant improvement in ventilation was obtained in 93 percent of patients with squamous cell carcinoma, 92 percent with large cell carcinoma, 90 percent with adenocarcinoma and 90 percent with small cell carcinoma. Location of the tumor was a major determinant of outcome (Figure 2).\nIt is difficult to draw conclusions regarding long› term results, since TNM restaging and performance status cannot be determined. Also, other therapies prior to and following laser treatment varied consid› erably\nThe cumulative survival percentages after the first laser treatment for 333 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma was 50 percent (-3 percent) at six months and 26 percent (-3 percent) at one year (Figure 3). Follow-up information was not available in 242 patients. Those who underwent surgery after laser resection are not included in the survival data. More important than length of survival was the obvious improvement in quality of life. It is worth noting that almost all patients with known data and cause of death died without recurrent obstructive symptoms.\nThis heading lumps together several tumor types characterized by slow growth and rare tendency to metastasize (Table 3).\nSome carcinoids deeply infiltrated the bronchial wall and appeared similar to bronchogenic carcinomas. In these cases, recurrence was relatively rapid, re› quiring further treatment. Other carcinoids appeared\npolypoid with endoluminal growth. Their macroscopic and microscopic presentation was benign. So far, 11 of the 12 carcinoids of this type have not recurred (follow› up of 10 to 50 months). Adenoid cystic carcinomas are often complex tumors, frequently widebased with a tendency to recur. Many of these required repeated treatment.\nOne mucoepidermoid carcinoma has not recurred after 40 months. Mixed tumors and particularly spin› dle-cell carcinomas tend to recur and require more than one treatment.\nThese are the best indication for laser therapy being mostly polypoid tumors and mainly localized. This means they are easy to resect with laser therapy and, most important, they rarely recur (Figure 4).\nFifty-nine patients were treated in 77 procedures. There were 14 hamartomas, 11 papillomas, seven amyloidoses, four osteoplastic tracheopathies, four pol› yps, four angiomas, two plasmocytomas, two schwan› nomas, two chondromas, two lipomas, two endome› trioses and one of each of the following: fibroma, scleroma, fibroleiomyoma, fibrohistiocytoma and tra› cheobronchial syphilis. In amyloidosis and osteoplastic tracheopathy the laser cannot be curative, but the growth process is very slow and our cases have not required further treatment thus far. One patient with amyloidosis has not required treatment since 1982. Among the other cases, only endometriosis and one papillomatosis required further treatment.\nThis group includes very simple cases together with decidedly difficult ones. We followed the classification\nused by Dumon et al 4 and subdivided our 139 cases into genuine tracheal stenoses (81) and tracheal gra› nulomas (58)(Table 4).\nThe most common etiology of tracheal granulation tissue was the presence of a metallic tracheostomy tube. In 21 cases, the granulation was induced by suture threads after sleeve resection. The use of reabsorbable suture material has now reduced the frequency of this complication. Results were almost always curative. The few recurrences were due to the appearance of other suture threads and, in patients with permanent tracheostomy tubes, to the persistence of mechanical irritation.\nOur 81 cases were almost all iatrogenic, caused by endotracheal intubation or closure of a tracheal stoma. There also were six postdiphtheritic and three post› traumatic stenoses, and two of unknown origin. Except for the five concentric stenoses, the obstruction ex› tended over several cartilage rings and the tracheal wall appeared to be involved with inflammation.\nImmediate results were almost always good (Figure 5). In 76 of 81 cases, there was immediate significant improvement. Three of the five poor results involved patients with total suprastomal stenosis (we treated six complete stenoses). The other two poor results were cases of postdiphtheritic tracheal stenosis also involv› ing the larynx.\nGenuine tracheal stenoses tend to recur following laser therapy. A stable result for over six months was achieved in 34 patients. Of the rest, sleeve resection was needed in 20; five died; eight were unavailable for follow-up; nine are recent and five had no lasting improvement but were not retreated. A silicone T› tube was used in 18 cases.\nBesides obstructing tumors and tracheal stenoses, there are other clinical situations treatable by endob› ronchial laser therapy. We treated 89 cases in 118 procedures, using the flexible fiberscope under local\nThe main complications were hypoxemia and related cardiovascular disorders induced by general anesthesia or severe hemorrhage (Table 6). In 1,396 treatments, we had ten hemorrhages of over 250 ml, all during surgery. Allwere managed without excessive difficulty and did not extend hospitalization times. Two medi› astinal emphysemas cleared spontaneously in five and six days. Four pneumothoraxes developed, probably due to reexpansion of atelectatic lung. Two cleared spontaneously in three and five days. The other two cleared in six and eight days with pleural drainage.\nThere were five deaths, giving a mortality rate of 0.35 percent (5 of 1,396). One patient with recurrent bronchogenic carcinoma died of myocardial infarction during treatment under local anesthesia. The other four deaths occurred in patients treated under general anesthesia. One patient with bronchogenic carcinoma died at the end of the treatment from a cardiac arrest. In the other patient with Hodgkins lymphoma, previ› ously treated with radiotherapy, the laser did not improve the tracheobronchial lumen, which was se› verely reduced mainly due to extrinsic compression. The patient died from respiratory failure 18 hours after treatment. Another had tracheobronchial stenosis after left tracheal sleeve pneumonectomy. Although good improvement of the stenotic airway was achieved, the patient died five hours later from respiratory failure. One patient with bronchogenic carcinoma suffered a severe myocardial infarction during laser treatment and died five days later despite intensive care.\nanesthesia in 23 procedures (Table 5). Resection of suture threads and bronchial granulomas and control of mild hemorrhages is normally easy and complete. On the other hand, bronchial stenoses following sleeve resection are very difficult to treat and frequently recur: five out of 12 in this series.\nWith fistulas, the laser was used to clean the fistulized zone of suture threads and necrotic tissue . Using this technique, four small fistulas closed spon› taneously, four medium-gauge ones closed after re› peated silver nitrate treatment, and one remained open.\nThe tubercular bronchial stenoses were particularly difficult to treat. Wenever managed to obtain a normal bronchial lumen caliber. But ventilation did appear to improve and was maintained.\nDysplasias were treated in an attempt to arrest their evolution into frank cancer. We used low-power (25 W) to kill the atypical cells without damaging the bronchial wall. Follow-upbiopsies of the treated areas at three and 12 months showed fibrous tissue.\nTwodifferent methods of laser application in bron› chology have been developed: via the rigid or the fiberoptic bronchoscope. In general, the flexible method is opted for by bronchoscopists who have little or no experience with the rigid bronchoscope.\nThe preference for the rigid bronchoscope by au› thors with the largest series of cases\" and by ourselves is essentially for safety reasons: using the wide oper› ating channel, the patient can be ventilated, blood and secretions aspirated, and laser coagulation util› ized. Furthermore, the rigid bronchoscope allows instrumental dilatation of nonneoplastic tracheobron› chial stenoses and mechanical resection of polypoid tumors with considerable savings of time.\nIn regard to our personal preference in using the laser on a continuous basis with pulses as long as 5 to 6 s at 35 W on large tumors, it must be pointed out that the laser is not directed onto a single point but is waved slowly over the surface of the tumor always on a course nearly parallel to the tracheobronchial walls. With this technique, we have never produced the dangerous \"popcorn\" effect due to vaporization of submucosal tissues or postoperative hemorrhage. Dur› ing the days immediately after therapy we have noted at the site of laser treatment a moderate production of fibrin debris, which is expectorated spontaneously in seven to ten days. Endoscopic removal can be symp› tomatologically useful but we have never found it really indispensable.\nThe results appear to be more than satisfactory which enables us to confirm the utility of the laser in treating various tracheobronchial lesions. With inop› erable malignant tumors, the laser has proved to be of valuable help, mainly in improving quality of life. Particularly suitable for laser therapy are tumors blocking the main stem bronchi and/or the trachea, ie, those causing severe dyspnea not likely to be tolerated for long. Laser treatment in these cases offers a number of advantages: it is rapid, immediately effective, repeatable and complementary with other therapies. Radiotherapy is useful after laser in cases of widespread intramural infiltration with an extralu› minal component.\nThe possibility of more accurately assessing the actual extent of neoplastic infiltration after reductive laser therapy is extremely interesting, since some patients originally thought to be inoperable can be sent to surgery while others can undergo less extensive surgery than expected.\nThe laser has also proved to be extremely useful in allowing drainage of purulent secretions distal to\nairway obstruction. This can prevent the serious com› plications of postobstructive sepsis, often improving the patients overall condition even if there is little or no improvement in lung function.\nIt is difficult to make a judgment of the long-term results. While we feel it may not be correct to state this as a criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of laser therapy we are in agreement with Brutinel et aP7in believing that it extends the duration of life.\nIn regard to bronchial carcinoids, we wish to point out that laser therapy can be curative in exclusively endoluminal polypoid forms. In an attempt to eradi› cate all tumor in these cases, as for benign polypoid tumors, we treat the base with a lower power setting, thus avoiding tissue loss while still obtaining a cytocidal effect.\nFor many benign tumors that are exclusively endol› uminal and polypoid, total removal with laser is often possible. Laser therapy for such lesions must be considered in preference to surgery\nIn nonmalignant tracheal stenoses, though we did not obtain particularly extraordinary results, we are convinced that the laser is extremely useful for restor› ing ventilation rapidly particularly in emergencies. With recurrent tracheal stenoses the laser affords time for assessment of more definitive therapy such as silicone T-tube insertion or sleeve resection.\nIn summary we have treated 1,000 patients with the Nd-YAG laser in 1,396 applications during five years. Ninety-two percent of the treatments were performed via the rigid bronchoscope, the other eight percent with a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. Our experience confirms the usefulness and safety of this relatively new technique for treating benign and malignant obstructing lesions of the tracheobronchial tree.\nA total of 1,751 treatments in 1,261 patients has now been performed. This additional experience has not modified our judgment on procedure.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT: Weare grateful to Doctors F: Beamis and Stanley M.

With large tumors we often used longer exposure times (several seconds) at 35 to 40 ~ and with nonmalignant tracheal stenoses, shorter exposure (0.5 s) at 70 to 80 W The ftexible bronchoscope was used alone in 116 (eight percent) treatments, all with patients under local anesthesia. The rigid bronchoscope was used for 1,280 (92 percent) procedures, 1,088 with patients under general and 192 with patient under local anesthesia. The latter mostly refer to our first year of activity when, unlike today anesthetists were not available on a regular basis. We frequently used the rigid bronchoscope to dilate some types of tracheal stenoses and, in polypoid tumors, to scoop out the endoluminal mass, following Dumons technique.8.15 With neoplasms, the laser was used initially to coagulate the mass with low power (25 to 30 W) and long pulse times (5 s~ After mechanical removal of the tumor, the airway wall was photocoagulated for hemostasis. The fiberoptic broncho› scope was used for minor, minimally vascular lesions and, inserted through a rigid bronchoscope, for bronchial lesions that were inaccessible.

Of the 593 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, 87 were treated two or more times for recurrence. The median time between first and second treatment was III days. Occasionally after laser resec› tion, neoplastic infiltration of the bronchial wall was sometimes seen to be more distal than had originally been thought. This allowed resective surgery in eight cases originally felt to be inoperable, and in another ten patients it allowed less extensive surgery than planned.\nBy far, the most common malignant cell type was squamous cell carcinoma (451, 69.5 percent), followed by adenocarcinomas (48, 7.4 percent), small cell car› cinomas (36, 5.5 percent) and large cell carcinomas (24, 3.7 percent). There also were 19 rare tumors: five carcinosarcomas, five carcinomas in situ , two sarco› mas, two malignant plasmocytomas, one teratoma and four malignant lymphomas (two Hodgkins and two non-Hodgkins). Metastatic tumors included 15 from the thyroid, seven from the kidney, five from the\nalmost always achieved in a single laser session, were invariably good and often spectacular. In the 592 bronchogenic carcinomas alone, we achieved a normal airway lumen gauge or a significant improvement in ventilation in 548 (92.4 percent). In only 45 (7.6 percent) did the laser have no effect; these were mainly obstructions due to external compression or extensive tumor extending distally Histologic tumor cell type had no important bearing on results; normal airway lumen or significant improvement in ventilation was obtained in 93 percent of patients with squamous cell carcinoma, 92 percent with large cell carcinoma, 90 percent with adenocarcinoma and 90 percent with small cell carcinoma. Location of the tumor was a major determinant of outcome (Figure 2).\nIt is difficult to draw conclusions regarding long› term results, since TNM restaging and performance status cannot be determined. Also, other therapies prior to and following laser treatment varied consid› erably\nThe cumulative survival percentages after the first laser treatment for 333 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma was 50 percent (-3 percent) at six months and 26 percent (-3 percent) at one year (Figure 3). Follow-up information was not available in 242 patients. Those who underwent surgery after laser resection are not included in the survival data. More important than length of survival was the obvious improvement in quality of life. It is worth noting that almost all patients with known data and cause of death died without recurrent obstructive symptoms.",

In 1,396 treatments, we had ten hemorrhages of over 250 ml, all during surgery. Allwere managed without excessive difficulty and did not extend hospitalization times. Two medi› astinal emphysemas cleared spontaneously in five and six days. Four pneumothoraxes developed, probably due to reexpansion of atelectatic lung. Two cleared spontaneously in three and five days. The other two cleared in six and eight days with pleural drainage.\nThere were five deaths, giving a mortality rate of 0.35 percent (5 of 1,396). One patient with recurrent bronchogenic carcinoma died of myocardial infarction during treatment under local anesthesia. The other four deaths occurred in patients treated under general anesthesia. One patient with bronchogenic carcinoma died at the end of the treatment from a cardiac arrest. In the other patient with Hodgkins lymphoma, previ› ously treated with radiotherapy, the laser did not improve the tracheobronchial lumen, which was se› verely reduced mainly due to extrinsic compression. The patient died from respiratory failure 18 hours after treatment. Another had tracheobronchial stenosis after left tracheal sleeve pneumonectomy. Although good improvement of the stenotic airway was achieved, the patient died five hours later from respiratory failure. One patient with bronchogenic carcinoma suffered a severe myocardial infarction during laser treatment and died five days later despite intensive care.\nanesthesia in 23 procedures (Table 5). Resection of suture threads and bronchial granulomas and control of mild hemorrhages is normally easy and complete. On the other hand, bronchial stenoses following sleeve resection are very difficult to treat and frequently recur: five out of 12 in this series.\nWith fistulas, the laser was used to clean the fistulized zone of suture threads and necrotic tissue . Using this technique, four small fistulas closed spon› taneously, four medium-gauge ones closed after re› peated silver nitrate treatment, and one remained open.\nThe tubercular bronchial stenoses were particularly difficult to treat. Wenever managed to obtain a normal bronchial lumen caliber. But ventilation did appear to improve and was maintained.\nDysplasias were treated in an attempt to arrest their evolution into frank cancer. We used low-power (25 W) to kill the atypical cells without damaging the bronchial wall. Follow-upbiopsies of the treated areas at three and 12 months showed fibrous tissue.",

      "content": "Twodifferent methods of laser application in bron› chology have been developed: via the rigid or the fiberoptic bronchoscope. In general, the flexible method is opted for by bronchoscopists who have little or no experience with the rigid bronchoscope.\nThe preference for the rigid bronchoscope by au› thors with the largest series of cases\" and by ourselves is essentially for safety reasons: using the wide oper› ating channel, the patient can be ventilated, blood and secretions aspirated, and laser coagulation util› ized. Furthermore, the rigid bronchoscope allows instrumental dilatation of nonneoplastic tracheobron› chial stenoses and mechanical resection of polypoid tumors with considerable savings of time.\nIn regard to our personal preference in using the laser on a continuous basis with pulses as long as 5 to 6 s at 35 W on large tumors, it must be pointed out that the laser is not directed onto a single point but is waved slowly over the surface of the tumor always on a course nearly parallel to the tracheobronchial walls. With this technique, we have never produced the dangerous \"popcorn\" effect due to vaporization of submucosal tissues or postoperative hemorrhage. Dur› ing the days immediately after therapy we have noted at the site of laser treatment a moderate production of fibrin debris, which is expectorated spontaneously in seven to ten days. Endoscopic removal can be symp› tomatologically useful but we have never found it really indispensable.",

      "content": "The results appear to be more than satisfactory which enables us to confirm the utility of the laser in treating various tracheobronchial lesions. With inop› erable malignant tumors, the laser has proved to be of valuable help, mainly in improving quality of life. Particularly suitable for laser therapy are tumors blocking the main stem bronchi and/or the trachea, ie, those causing severe dyspnea not likely to be tolerated for long. Laser treatment in these cases offers a number of advantages: it is rapid, immediately effective, repeatable and complementary with other therapies. Radiotherapy is useful after laser in cases of widespread intramural infiltration with an extralu› minal component.\nThe possibility of more accurately assessing the actual extent of neoplastic infiltration after reductive laser therapy is extremely interesting, since some patients originally thought to be inoperable can be sent to surgery while others can undergo less extensive surgery than expected.\nThe laser has also proved to be extremely useful in allowing drainage of purulent secretions distal to\nairway obstruction. This can prevent the serious com› plications of postobstructive sepsis, often improving the patients overall condition even if there is little or no improvement in lung function.\nIt is difficult to make a judgment of the long-term results. While we feel it may not be correct to state this as a criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of laser therapy we are in agreement with Brutinel et aP7in believing that it extends the duration of life.\nIn regard to bronchial carcinoids, we wish to point out that laser therapy can be curative in exclusively endoluminal polypoid forms. In an attempt to eradi› cate all tumor in these cases, as for benign polypoid tumors, we treat the base with a lower power setting, thus avoiding tissue loss while still obtaining a cytocidal effect.\nFor many benign tumors that are exclusively endol› uminal and polypoid, total removal with laser is often possible. Laser therapy for such lesions must be considered in preference to surgery\nIn nonmalignant tracheal stenoses, though we did not obtain particularly extraordinary results, we are convinced that the laser is extremely useful for restor› ing ventilation rapidly particularly in emergencies. With recurrent tracheal stenoses the laser affords time for assessment of more definitive therapy such as silicone T-tube insertion or sleeve resection.\nIn summary we have treated 1,000 patients with the Nd-YAG laser in 1,396 applications during five years. Ninety-two percent of the treatments were performed via the rigid bronchoscope, the other eight percent with a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. Our experience confirms the usefulness and safety of this relatively new technique for treating benign and malignant obstructing lesions of the tracheobronchial tree.",
