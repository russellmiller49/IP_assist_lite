We have developed a novel procedure which allows sampling of SPNs via a transparenchymal approach, and report the results from this as a fi rst in human trial.\nMethods This study was a prospective single-arm interventional study. We recruited patients with a SPN detected on CT imaging, which was suspicious for lung cancer, who were suitable for surgical resection.

In Europe, there were 400 000 people diagnosed with lung cancer, and approximately 350 000 expected deaths in 2010. 1 Five-year survival remains poor at 9.0%. On a global basis, the 2012 statistics suggested that lung cancer was responsible for 1.59 million deaths. 2 The problem is compounded as most lung cancers are diagnosed late in their natural history , and about 75% of patients have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. 3 Hence, identi fi cation of patients with lung cancer at the earliest stage is vital if outcomes\nfor lung cancer are to be improved. Results from the National Lung Screening Trial have been very encouraging and have suggested a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality in the screened group. 4 However, approximately 25% of the scans demonstrated a nodule, of which most (96.4%) were nonmalignant. Furthermore, 713 (4%) of participants required a surgical procedure to establish a diagnosis. This was associated with a signi fi cant morbidity, as 165 subjects (23% of those undergoing surgery) had at least one complication and there were fi ve deaths. Increased use of surgery for the management of screen-detected nodules shifts the value of screening due to the cost implications and risks of surgical procedures. 5 A recent meta-analysis of 39 clinical studies evaluating a variety of bronchoscopic techniques with over 3000 solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) sampled demonstrated a wide diagnostic range from 18% to 75%. 6 Transthoracic procedures have a greater accuracy but with higher complication rates, especially pneumothoraces that occur in 15% of cases. 7\nSeveral bronchoscopic approaches exist; standard bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy under fl uoroscopic guidance, 8 ultrathin bronchoscopy, 9 virtual bronchoscopy-guided biopsy, 10 radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy , 11 electromagnetic\n\n## hat is the key question?\n\n\u25b8 As current diagnostic techniques for peripheral nodules detected by CT screening have particular risks and limitations, we have evaluated the safety and feasibility of a new transpulmonary approach to sample pulmonary nodules.\n\n## hat is the bottom line?\n\n\u25b8 Bronchoscopic transparenchymal nodule access is a novel technique for sampling peripheral lung nodules that is not dependent on an airway leading into the nodule.\n\n## hy read on?\n\n\u25b8 This fi rst in human study has demonstrated that it is a safe approach that is technically feasible with a high success rate.\nnavigation-guided biopsy, 12 and even combinations of these techniques. 13 The vast majority of the data originates from single centres, and the yield ranges from 67% to 73%. The yield is dependent on the size of the pulmonary nodule and distance from the hilum. The diagnostic rate for nodules smaller than 20 mm is much lower (46%). 14 Some nodules are eccentrically positioned and may not have an airway directly leading to them. 15 Hence, it may not be possible to approach the nodule via the bronchial tree. Furthermore, navigation and manoeuvring through several subsegments is challenging. Consequently , the yield decreases with each successive branching beyond fourth-generation bronchial segments.\nWe have developed a novel bronchoscopic technique for accessing nodules through a transparenchymal approach which is not dependent on the need to have an airway leading into the lesion. W e report the feasibility and safety of the Bronchoscopic Trans-Parenchymal Nodule Access (BTPNA) procedure in this fi rst in human study.\n\n## tudy design and participants\n\nThis study was a prospective single-arm interventional study. This procedure was developed for sampling SPNs, which are de fi ned as lesions of up to 30 mm diameter. However, for safety reasons, as this was a fi rst in human study, we recruited patients with lesions of up to 40 mm diameter from suspected lung cancer or metastatic disease, who were suitable for surgical resection. For simplicity, we have used the term SPN throughout the manuscript. The SPNs were required to be located in the pulmonary parenchyma at least 10 mm away from the pleural surface. Participants were required to ful fi l all the inclusion criteria in the absence of any exclusion criteria (see box 1), and provide written informed consent.\n\n## lanning stage\n\nComputerised tomograms from eligible subjects were uploaded onto the Archimedes Virtual Bronchoscopy Navigation (VBN) System (Broncus Medical, Mountain View, California, USA) which is a software system that reconstructs the CT data into a 3D model, including bronchial airways, vascular structures, ribs and lungs, and provides features to allow the user to mark and segment a target, that is, a suspicious SPN. The system calculates two suitable point of entry (POE) locations with straight line, vessel-free access to the SPN, as well as bronchoscopy paths for guiding the user ' s bronchoscope to the POE locations. Additionally, the Archimedes System displays the tunnel path from the POE on the airway wall to the SPN. The user is allowed to fi ne-tune the POE location using a ' Virtual Doppler ' tool, which enables the user to inspect for presence of vessels outside of the airway wall in the virtual bronchoscopy view. Users are also able to visualise the blood vessels during the virtual bronchoscopy review of the path to the selected POE, which is painted as a target on the airway wall. A cylindrical icon on the POE describes the orientation of the bronchoscope. The bronchial diameter, bronchoscopy path distance, tunnel length to the front of the target, target size, and distance from the back of the target to the nearest pleura location are all provided in the virtual bronchoscopy view. During the procedure, the Archimedes System integrates real-time fl uoroscopy data with the 3D CT data to guide a sheath from the POE on the airway wall through the lung parenchyma directly to the SPN.\n\n## rocedure\n\nThe bronchoscopic procedure was performed under general anaesthesia and muscle paralysis. The procedure was performed in the operating room as a precaution in the event of a serious event such as a major haemorrhage. T wo procedures were performed by FJFH on a simulation model prior to the fi rst patient procedure. As a further precautionary measure, a balloon blocker (Cohen Balloon, Cook Medical, Ireland) was placed at the main stem of the bronchus leading to the lobe where the nodule was located. The balloon was in fl ated to check adequate positioning and the volume of air required for correct in fl ation of the spherical balloon. 16 The balloon blocker was then locked in position and the balloon de fl ated. A standard bronchoscopy was also performed to ensure that there were no endobronchial lesions.\n\n## nclusion criteria\n\n\u25b8 Subjects suitable for surgery, aged 21 years -75 years\n\u25b8 Nodule due to suspected lung cancer or metastatic disease\n\u25b8 Nodule measuring greater than 10 mm and up to 40 mm in largest dimension\n\u25b8 No known endobronchial tumour\n\u25b8 Nodule located anywhere in parenchymal tissue >1 cm from pleura\n\u25b8 Nodule accessible bronchoscopically through a point of entry on planning CT reconstruction\n\u25b8 Subject able to understand study requirements\n\u25b8 Subject able to provide signed consent\n\n## xclusion Criteria\n\n\u25b8 An inability to tolerate bronchoscopy under heavy sedation or general anaesthesia\n\u25b8 Long-term use of anticoagulants (eg, heparin, warfarin) or antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel) which cannot be discontinued\n\u25b8 Uncorrectable coagulopathy\n\u25b8 Platelet dysfunction or platelet count <100\u00d710\n\u25b8 History of major bleeding with bronchoscopy\n\u25b8 Pulmonary hypertension with mean PAP >25 mm\n\u25b8 Moderate-to-severe pulmonary fi brosis\n\u25b8 Moderate-to-severe emphysema or Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with FEV1 <60% predicted or RV >200% predicted\n\u25b8 Bullae >5 cm located in vicinity of target SPN tunnel\n\u25b8 Any other severe or life-threatening comorbidity that could increase the risk of bronchoscopic biopsy tunnelling, for example:\n-ASA class >3\n->stage 3 heart failure (New York Heart Failure Classi fi cation)\n-severe cachexia\n-severe respiratory insuf fi ciency or hypoxia\n\u25b8 Ongoing systemic infection\n\u25b8 Contraindication to general anaesthesia\n\u25b8 Participation in any other study in last 30 days\n\u25b8 Prior thoracic surgery on the same side of the lung as the SPN\n\u25b8 Pregnant or lactating\n\u25b8 Patients with known intrapulmonary metastases of extrapulmonary cancer/tumors\nPAP, pulmonary arterial pressure; RV, right ventricel; TNM, tumor staging, tumor nodules, metastasis; TPNA, transparenchymal nodule access.\nThe Archimedes System provided virtual bronchoscopy guidance to the selected POE. Once the POE location was reached, the subsequent procedural steps were adapted from the airway bypass procedure that was performed for the treatment of severe emphysema. 17 A coring needle (FleXNeedle, Broncus Medical, Mountain View, California, USA) was inserted through the working channel of a standard therapeutic bronchoscope (1T180, Olympus Medical, Tokyo, Japan) and through the airway wall at the identi fi ed POE in the airway ( fi gure 1). Aspiration was performed during slow withdrawal of the needle to further con fi rm that there was no vascular puncture during needle insertion. An atraumatic balloon dilator was used to enlarge the hole made at the POE, and a sheath with a blunt dissection stylet was inserted through the entry hole created in the airway. The sheath with radiopaque marker bands and a blunt dissection stylet was then used to create a tunnel within the lung parenchyma to the proximal aspect of the nodule under fused fl uoroscopy guidance. The projection of the 3D target nodule from the CT model and tunnel ' guide rails ' were displayed on the fused fl uoroscopy image. Once the sheath tip was advanced up to 10 mm through the POE, the orientation of the tip was adjusted towards the target and con fi rmed with multiple fl uoroscopy projections. Con fi rmation of the tunnel direction was repeated every 10 mm -20 mm of advancement throughout the tunnelling process. Once the proximal aspect of the nodule was reached, with suf fi cient clearance for opening the forceps, the stylet was removed and biopsy forceps was inserted through the sheath and biopsy samples were taken under fused fl uoroscopy guidance. Where the nodules were not visible at fl uoroscopy, the sheath and blunt dissection stylet were advanced to the edge of the target displayed on the fused fl uoroscopy view. Furthermore, in these cases, during biopsy sampling, the patient was put on a breath-hold state each time a sample was taken to suppress the breathing motion. Additionally, since the tip of the sheath/tunnel is within close proximity of the lesion, the motion of the sheath/tunnel tip is in synchrony with the target itself.\n\n## ung resection\n\nAfter performing the BTPNA procedure, a portable chest radiograph was performed; complications, if any, were recorded, and surgical resection of the SPN was performed. The resected lobe was carefully inspected to assess the tunnel path proximity to the sampled nodule. This was veri fi ed by a pathologist. The histology from the transbronchial lung biopsies obtained at BTPNA was compared with the histology of the nodule from the resected lobe.\n\n## utcomes\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate feasibility to access and biopsy the nodule by the BTPNA procedure. Safety was evaluated by carefully assessing the subject for any intraprocedural complications, such as localised bleeding, development of a pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or cardio-pulmonary instability . Furthermore, careful inspection of the POE into the, lung parenchyma and tunnel path was performed intraoperatively at surgical resection, and also in the resected specimen to identify any potential complications related to the BTPNA procedure. Outpatient follow-up was conducted at 90 days and 180 days to detect any subsequent serious adverse events. The severity of adverse events was de fi ned according to the ISO 14155:2011 de fi nition.\nFeasibility was de fi ned as the proportion of subjects in whom the procedure could be completed with obtainment of at least one biopsy suf fi cient for a histological diagnosis divided by the\nnumber of subjects in whom at least one attempt for BTPNA was made. Further information was obtained by inspecting the resected lobe to assess the tunnel path and its proximity to the SPN. The histology from the biopsy forceps samples was also correlated with that of the nodule from the resected lobe.\nSecondary endpoints included parameters such as the biopsy yield, de fi ned as the number of nodules with at least one biopsy suf fi cient for a tissue diagnosis divided by the number of nodules sampled. Other parameters evaluated included procedural time points, length of tunnel path created, number and adequacy of the biopsy samples.\n\n## tatistical analysis\n\nContinuous outcomes are summarised with mean, SD and other relevant statistical summaries. Where the outcomes were not normally distributed, medians and quartiles are reported. Changes in continuous variables are assessed with paired or unpaired Student ' s t tests, as appropriate. Binary and ordinal outcomes were tabulated. Rates were expressed as percentages, and CIs for proportions were calculated using the exact binomial distribution.\nThis is a fi rst in human feasibility study and, hence, we did not perform a formal power calculation. T welve subjects undergoing biopsy via the transparenchymal sampling procedure using the Archimedes platform have provided pilot information on overall safety and feasibility .\n\n## ESULTS\n\nTwelve patients were enrolled in this study (6 men and 6 women) with a median age of 62 years (range 40 -72). The BTPNA procedure was successfully completed in 10 patients (83%), and a positive biopsy was successfully obtained in all 10 cases in which a tunnel was successfully created from the POE to the SPN. The key procedural steps from a BTPNA procedure are shown in fi gure 2. There were no signi fi cant intraprocedural adverse events (Table 1). Fluoroscopy, after completion of the procedure, did not reveal any occurrence of adverse events, such as pneumothorax. Inspection during surgical resection and of the resected lobe did not reveal any evidence of localised haemorrhage, bronchial or pulmonary lacerations. The only adverse event observed was a transient rise in troponin levels in one patient post-BTPNA and surgical resection. Outpatient follow-up conducted at 90 days and 180 days after the procedure did not reveal any adverse events attributable to the procedure.\nAdequate histological sampling suf fi cient for a histological diagnosis was successfully achieved in 10 of the patients. Inspection at surgery and in the postresection specimens demonstrated that the tunnel path was created in the correct position and orientation that led directly to the target nodule. Figure 3 demonstrates the tract created in one of the patients. Furthermore, the histological fi ndings from the biopsies obtained by BTPNA correlated with the fi nal pathology in all the surgically resected nodules ( fi gure 4). In the two patients where the BTPNA procedure could not be completed, the nodules were located in the apical section of the left upper lobe. In these patients, it was not possible to orientate the bronchoscope at the POE location to achieve a straight-line tunnel path to the target nodule due to limitations of the bronchoscope size and angulation, and proximity of the aorta and pulmonary artery. Furthermore, alternative access points were not practical due to the close proximity of major blood vessels. However, we were able to access nodules in the left upper lobe using the BTPNA approach in two other patients. In this initial study, there were no patients with a nodule in the right upper lobe, and the other nodules were distributed throughout the lung.\nIn seven of the 12 patients, the nodules were not visible at fl uoroscopy. Despite this, using Archimedes fused fl uoroscopy guidance, the procedure was successfully completed in six of these seven patients. In the one patient where the procedure was not completed, the main factor was the dif fi culty in fi nding a vessel-free path. Both histological con fi rmation and postresection evaluation of the tract con fi rmed accurate performance of the BTPNA procedure.\nThe mean procedure time was 39.8 min, with the planning stage accounting for 18.0 (range 10.0 -30.0) min, and the creation of the tunnelled pathway 21.8 (range 12.0 -40.0) min (Table 1). The fl uoroscopy time was 5.5 (range 1.8 -11.6) min. The mean tunnel length was 47 (range 10 -90) mm. The overall yield for BTPNA was 83% (10 out of 12) as the tract could not be created in two patients, as described above. The biopsy yield\nwas 100% for procedures where a tunnelled pathway was created, and at least one biopsy attempted. An average of 3.3 biopsy samples were obtained (range 0 -6) in the 12 patients who underwent BTPNA.\n\n## ISCUSSION\n\nThis report is a fi rst in human study that evaluates the safety and feasibility of a novel approach for the access to and diagnosis of SPNs. Although the concept of creating access from the bronchial tree to the lung parenchyma has been explored in patients with severe emphysema, 17 this is the fi rst human report of creating tunnelled paths from the bronchial segments through the lung parenchyma directly to the SPNs. The procedure was successfully performed in 10 out of 12 patients with no signi fi cant adverse events observed at the time of the procedure or in the follow-up period. There was no evidence of signi fi cant immediate bleeding or pneumothoraces, which were the primary safety concerns for this approach. Clinical follow-up at 6 months did not discover any unanticipated adverse events. It was challenging to evaluate the postprocedure safety in this study as the patients proceeded directly to surgical resection. However, this provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the tunnel paths created and inspect the resected lung for any lacerations or bleeding in the surrounding lung parenchyma. The current standard of transthoracic\nWhere size is the long axis diameter. *All areas involved in TPNA resected and no concerns identified. LLL, left lower lobe; LUL, left upper lobe; Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), non-small cell lung cancer; RLL, right lower lobe; RML, right middle lobe.\nCT-guided biopsy appears to have a pneumothorax risk of 15% and serious bleeding risk of 1%. 7\nThe creation of a tunnelled path and the use of a sheath enabled multiple biopsies to be performed with minimal additional risk. In this study, an average of 3.3 (range 0 -6) biopsies was performed, with at least four biopsies performed in eight participants, with no evidence of increased complications with greater biopsy number. By contrast, for transthoracic needle biopsies, the number of needle insertions is associated with a greater risk of pneumothoraces. 18 This increased pneumothorax risk is primarily related to the number of times the needle passes through the pleura, whereas with BTPNA, this risk is avoided. 19 Furthermore, with CT-guided biopsy, the depth of needle insertion, or the distance between the pleura and the nodule, is related to both an increased risk of a pneumothorax and also the need for chest tube placement. 20 In this early report with BTPNA, there was no increased risk of adverse events irrespective of the tunnel length created, despite the fact that lengths of 50 mm or greater were created in seven patients. In one patient, a 90 mm long tunnelled pathway was safely created and a biopsy successfully performed. The current limitation of BTPNA appears to be the apex of the lung where it is more dif fi cult to control the angulation and orientation of the sheath and dissection tip in the required direction, particularly in the apex of the left upper lobe which is blocked from access by the aorta and pulmonary artery. The true extent of this limitation will become clearer with greater experience in this procedure.\nThe procedure may appear more complicated than a transthoracic CT-guided biopsy, but this early feasibility study appears to\nhave a lower risk of immediate adverse events. A learning curve was demonstrated with the fi rst four, second four and third four tunnel creation times averaging 35.0, 21.5 and 13.3 min, respectively . Hence, after only eight procedures, the procedure time of BTPNA is comparable to either transthoracic CT-guided biopsy or standard transbronchial biopsy. BTPNA may have a complimentary role with transthoracic needle aspiration, as the former may be a more appropriate choice for nodules or tumours in certain anatomical locations, for example, centrally located nodules or behind the scapula, or where two pleural planes need to be traversed for a transthoracic approach. It may also be a safer approach in patients with emphysema due to the lower risk of pneumothorax. About a third of patients with potentially curable disease do not undergo surgical resection due to factors, such as disease, comorbidity and age. 21 In the future, our approach may facilitate local treatment of early lung cancers in this group of patients.\nIn conclusion, the BTPNA approach improves the accessibility of peripheral nodules via the bronchoscopic route. In this small pilot study, the technique appears to be safe and feasible. Further research is warranted with multicentre interventional studies and, ultimately, a randomised controlled study against the current standard of transthoracic lung biopsy.\n\n## witter Follow Pallav Shah at @BromptonLungDoc\n\nContributors The Archimedes platform and tools were developed by Broncus Medical.

      "content": "Introduction The promise of bene fi ts from lung cancer screening is tempered by the false positive rate and the need to perform diagnostic procedures to determine the aetiology of the solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) identi fi ed. We have developed a novel procedure which allows sampling of SPNs via a transparenchymal approach, and report the results from this as a fi rst in human trial.\nMethods This study was a prospective single-arm interventional study. We recruited patients with a SPN detected on CT imaging, which was suspicious for lung cancer, who were suitable for surgical resection. Using the subject ' s CT, an optimal airway wall point of entry (POE), and an avascular path through lung tissue from the POE to the SPN was calculated. A tunnel tract was created from the POE to the nodule using a set of catheter-based tools under fused fl uoroscopy guidance. The patients proceeded to surgical resection immediately after the biopsy. The participants were followed-up for 6 months after the procedure. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the feasibility to access and biopsy the nodule.\nResults Twelve patients were recruited, and a tunnel pathway created in 10 patients. There were no adverse events during the procedures. Adequate biopsies were obtained from 10 patients (83%), which correlated with the histological fi ndings from the surgical resection. Inspection of the resected lobes did not raise any safety concerns and indicated appropriately tunnelled pathways to the nodule.\nConclusions This fi rst in human study demonstrates that bronchoscopic transparenchymal access of SPNs is feasible.\nTrial registration number NCT02130115.",

      "content": "Lung cancer remains a challenging disease despite clear knowledge of its aetiology. In Europe, there were 400 000 people diagnosed with lung cancer, and approximately 350 000 expected deaths in 2010. 1 Five-year survival remains poor at 9.0%. On a global basis, the 2012 statistics suggested that lung cancer was responsible for 1.59 million deaths. 2 The problem is compounded as most lung cancers are diagnosed late in their natural history , and about 75% of patients have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. 3 Hence, identi fi cation of patients with lung cancer at the earliest stage is vital if outcomes\nfor lung cancer are to be improved. Results from the National Lung Screening Trial have been very encouraging and have suggested a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality in the screened group. 4 However, approximately 25% of the scans demonstrated a nodule, of which most (96.4%) were nonmalignant. Furthermore, 713 (4%) of participants required a surgical procedure to establish a diagnosis. This was associated with a signi fi cant morbidity, as 165 subjects (23% of those undergoing surgery) had at least one complication and there were fi ve deaths. Increased use of surgery for the management of screen-detected nodules shifts the value of screening due to the cost implications and risks of surgical procedures. 5 A recent meta-analysis of 39 clinical studies evaluating a variety of bronchoscopic techniques with over 3000 solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) sampled demonstrated a wide diagnostic range from 18% to 75%. 6 Transthoracic procedures have a greater accuracy but with higher complication rates, especially pneumothoraces that occur in 15% of cases. 7\nSeveral bronchoscopic approaches exist; standard bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy under fl uoroscopic guidance, 8 ultrathin bronchoscopy, 9 virtual bronchoscopy-guided biopsy, 10 radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy , 11 electromagnetic",

The system calculates two suitable point of entry (POE) locations with straight line, vessel-free access to the SPN, as well as bronchoscopy paths for guiding the user ' s bronchoscope to the POE locations. Additionally, the Archimedes System displays the tunnel path from the POE on the airway wall to the SPN. The user is allowed to fi ne-tune the POE location using a ' Virtual Doppler ' tool, which enables the user to inspect for presence of vessels outside of the airway wall in the virtual bronchoscopy view. Users are also able to visualise the blood vessels during the virtual bronchoscopy review of the path to the selected POE, which is painted as a target on the airway wall. A cylindrical icon on the POE describes the orientation of the bronchoscope. The bronchial diameter, bronchoscopy path distance, tunnel length to the front of the target, target size, and distance from the back of the target to the nearest pleura location are all provided in the virtual bronchoscopy view.

Once the POE location was reached, the subsequent procedural steps were adapted from the airway bypass procedure that was performed for the treatment of severe emphysema. 17 A coring needle (FleXNeedle, Broncus Medical, Mountain View, California, USA) was inserted through the working channel of a standard therapeutic bronchoscope (1T180, Olympus Medical, Tokyo, Japan) and through the airway wall at the identi fi ed POE in the airway ( fi gure 1). Aspiration was performed during slow withdrawal of the needle to further con fi rm that there was no vascular puncture during needle insertion. An atraumatic balloon dilator was used to enlarge the hole made at the POE, and a sheath with a blunt dissection stylet was inserted through the entry hole created in the airway. The sheath with radiopaque marker bands and a blunt dissection stylet was then used to create a tunnel within the lung parenchyma to the proximal aspect of the nodule under fused fl uoroscopy guidance. The projection of the 3D target nodule from the CT model and tunnel ' guide rails ' were displayed on the fused fl uoroscopy image. Once the sheath tip was advanced up to 10 mm through the POE, the orientation of the tip was adjusted towards the target and con fi rmed with multiple fl uoroscopy projections. Con fi rmation of the tunnel direction was repeated every 10 mm -20 mm of advancement throughout the tunnelling process. Once the proximal aspect of the nodule was reached, with suf fi cient clearance for opening the forceps, the stylet was removed and biopsy forceps was inserted through the sheath and biopsy samples were taken under fused fl uoroscopy guidance. Where the nodules were not visible at fl uoroscopy, the sheath and blunt dissection stylet were advanced to the edge of the target displayed on the fused fl uoroscopy view. Furthermore, in these cases, during biopsy sampling, the patient was put on a breath-hold state each time a sample was taken to suppress the breathing motion. Additionally, since the tip of the sheath/tunnel is within close proximity of the lesion, the motion of the sheath/tunnel tip is in synchrony with the target itself.",

      "content": "Twelve patients were enrolled in this study (6 men and 6 women) with a median age of 62 years (range 40 -72). The BTPNA procedure was successfully completed in 10 patients (83%), and a positive biopsy was successfully obtained in all 10 cases in which a tunnel was successfully created from the POE to the SPN. The key procedural steps from a BTPNA procedure are shown in fi gure 2. There were no signi fi cant intraprocedural adverse events (Table 1). Fluoroscopy, after completion of the procedure, did not reveal any occurrence of adverse events, such as pneumothorax. Inspection during surgical resection and of the resected lobe did not reveal any evidence of localised haemorrhage, bronchial or pulmonary lacerations. The only adverse event observed was a transient rise in troponin levels in one patient post-BTPNA and surgical resection. Outpatient follow-up conducted at 90 days and 180 days after the procedure did not reveal any adverse events attributable to the procedure.\nAdequate histological sampling suf fi cient for a histological diagnosis was successfully achieved in 10 of the patients. Inspection at surgery and in the postresection specimens demonstrated that the tunnel path was created in the correct position and orientation that led directly to the target nodule. Figure 3 demonstrates the tract created in one of the patients. Furthermore, the histological fi ndings from the biopsies obtained by BTPNA correlated with the fi nal pathology in all the surgically resected nodules ( fi gure 4). In the two patients where the BTPNA procedure could not be completed, the nodules were located in the apical section of the left upper lobe. In these patients, it was not possible to orientate the bronchoscope at the POE location to achieve a straight-line tunnel path to the target nodule due to limitations of the bronchoscope size and angulation, and proximity of the aorta and pulmonary artery. Furthermore, alternative access points were not practical due to the close proximity of major blood vessels. However, we were able to access nodules in the left upper lobe using the BTPNA approach in two other patients. In this initial study, there were no patients with a nodule in the right upper lobe, and the other nodules were distributed throughout the lung.\nIn seven of the 12 patients, the nodules were not visible at fl uoroscopy. Despite this, using Archimedes fused fl uoroscopy guidance, the procedure was successfully completed in six of these seven patients. In the one patient where the procedure was not completed, the main factor was the dif fi culty in fi nding a vessel-free path. Both histological con fi rmation and postresection evaluation of the tract con fi rmed accurate performance of the BTPNA procedure.\nThe mean procedure time was 39.8 min, with the planning stage accounting for 18.0 (range 10.0 -30.0) min, and the creation of the tunnelled pathway 21.8 (range 12.0 -40.0) min (Table 1). The fl uoroscopy time was 5.5 (range 1.8 -11.6) min. The mean tunnel length was 47 (range 10 -90) mm. The overall yield for BTPNA was 83% (10 out of 12) as the tract could not be created in two patients, as described above. The biopsy yield\nwas 100% for procedures where a tunnelled pathway was created, and at least one biopsy attempted. An average of 3.3 biopsy samples were obtained (range 0 -6) in the 12 patients who underwent BTPNA.",

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "This report is a fi rst in human study that evaluates the safety and feasibility of a novel approach for the access to and diagnosis of SPNs. Although the concept of creating access from the bronchial tree to the lung parenchyma has been explored in patients with severe emphysema, 17 this is the fi rst human report of creating tunnelled paths from the bronchial segments through the lung parenchyma directly to the SPNs. The procedure was successfully performed in 10 out of 12 patients with no signi fi cant adverse events observed at the time of the procedure or in the follow-up period. There was no evidence of signi fi cant immediate bleeding or pneumothoraces, which were the primary safety concerns for this approach. Clinical follow-up at 6 months did not discover any unanticipated adverse events. It was challenging to evaluate the postprocedure safety in this study as the patients proceeded directly to surgical resection. However, this provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the tunnel paths created and inspect the resected lung for any lacerations or bleeding in the surrounding lung parenchyma. The current standard of transthoracic\nWhere size is the long axis diameter. *All areas involved in TPNA resected and no concerns identified. LLL, left lower lobe; LUL, left upper lobe; Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), non-small cell lung cancer; RLL, right lower lobe; RML, right middle lobe.\nCT-guided biopsy appears to have a pneumothorax risk of 15% and serious bleeding risk of 1%. 7\nThe creation of a tunnelled path and the use of a sheath enabled multiple biopsies to be performed with minimal additional risk. In this study, an average of 3.3 (range 0 -6) biopsies was performed, with at least four biopsies performed in eight participants, with no evidence of increased complications with greater biopsy number. By contrast, for transthoracic needle biopsies, the number of needle insertions is associated with a greater risk of pneumothoraces. 18 This increased pneumothorax risk is primarily related to the number of times the needle passes through the pleura, whereas with BTPNA, this risk is avoided. 19 Furthermore, with CT-guided biopsy, the depth of needle insertion, or the distance between the pleura and the nodule, is related to both an increased risk of a pneumothorax and also the need for chest tube placement. 20 In this early report with BTPNA, there was no increased risk of adverse events irrespective of the tunnel length created, despite the fact that lengths of 50 mm or greater were created in seven patients. In one patient, a 90 mm long tunnelled pathway was safely created and a biopsy successfully performed. The current limitation of BTPNA appears to be the apex of the lung where it is more dif fi cult to control the angulation and orientation of the sheath and dissection tip in the required direction, particularly in the apex of the left upper lobe which is blocked from access by the aorta and pulmonary artery. The true extent of this limitation will become clearer with greater experience in this procedure.\nThe procedure may appear more complicated than a transthoracic CT-guided biopsy, but this early feasibility study appears to\nhave a lower risk of immediate adverse events. A learning curve was demonstrated with the fi rst four, second four and third four tunnel creation times averaging 35.0, 21.5 and 13.3 min, respectively . Hence, after only eight procedures, the procedure time of BTPNA is comparable to either transthoracic CT-guided biopsy or standard transbronchial biopsy. BTPNA may have a complimentary role with transthoracic needle aspiration, as the former may be a more appropriate choice for nodules or tumours in certain anatomical locations, for example, centrally located nodules or behind the scapula, or where two pleural planes need to be traversed for a transthoracic approach. It may also be a safer approach in patients with emphysema due to the lower risk of pneumothorax. About a third of patients with potentially curable disease do not undergo surgical resection due to factors, such as disease, comorbidity and age. 21 In the future, our approach may facilitate local treatment of early lung cancers in this group of patients.\nIn conclusion, the BTPNA approach improves the accessibility of peripheral nodules via the bronchoscopic route. In this small pilot study, the technique appears to be safe and feasible. Further research is warranted with multicentre interventional studies and, ultimately, a randomised controlled study against the current standard of transthoracic lung biopsy.",
