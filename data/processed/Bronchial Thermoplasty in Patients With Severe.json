The Post-FDA Approval Clinical Trial Evaluating Bronchial Thermoplasty in Severe Persistent Asthma (PAS2) study collected data on patients with severe asthma undergoing this procedure. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the 5-year efficacy and safety results in patients with severe asthma who have undergone bronchial thermoplasty? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective, open-label, observational, multicenter study conducted in the United States and Canada. Subjects 18 to 65 years of age who were taking inhaled corticosteroids \u2265 1,000 \u03bcg/d (beclomethasone or equivalent) and long-acting beta-agonists \u2265 80 \u03bcg/d (salmeterol or equivalent) were included. Severe exacerbations, hospitalization, ED visits, and medication usage were evaluated for the 12 months prior to and at years 1 through 5 posttreatment. Spirometry was evaluated at baseline and at years 1 through 5 posttreatment. RESULTS: A total of 284 subjects were enrolled at 27 centers; 227 subjects (80%) completed 5 years of follow-up. By year 5 posttreatment, the proportion of subjects with severe exacerbations, ED visits, and hospitalizations was 42.7%, 7.9%, and 4.8%, respectively, compared with 77.8%, 29.4%, and 16.1% in the 12 months prior to treatment. The proportion of subjects on maintenance oral corticosteroids decreased from 19.4% at baseline to 9.7% at 5 years. Analyses of subgroups based on baseline clinical and biomarker characteristics revealed a statistically significant clinical improvement among all subgroups. INTERPRETATION: Five years after treatment, subjects experienced decreases in severe exacerbations, hospitalizations, ED visits, and corticosteroid exposure. All subgroups demonstrated clinically significant improvement, suggesting that bronchial thermoplasty improves asthma control in different asthma phenotypes.

Ten percent of patients have severe, poorly controlled disease despite optimal medical therapy. These patients account for > 80% of asthma-related health care costs. 1-3\nBronchial thermoplasty (BT) is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved procedure for the treatment of asthma. It is indicated for patients $ 18 years of age with severe persistent asthma not well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and long-acting betaagonists (LABAs). BT uses radiofrequency energy to heat the airway walls in a controlled manner. The mechanism of action is attributed to a reduction in airway smooth muscle mass after the procedure. 4-9 Reduction in airway smooth muscle has been associated with clinical improvement seen in patients undergoing BT. 5,6 Other structural and immunohistologic changes after BT, including reduction in reticular basement membrane thickness, reduction in collagen type I deposition, and changes in neuroendocrine cells, may also contribute to clinical improvement. 4,6,10,11\nSeveral randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of BT have been carried out in subjects with moderate to severe asthma, including the Asthma Intervention Research (AIR), Research in Severe Asthma (RISA), and Asthma Intervention Research 2 (AIR2) studies. 12-15 These studies demonstrated improvements in asthma control after BT, including decreased numbers of asthma exacerbations, ED visits, and hospitalizations. In addition, subjects experienced improved quality of life as measured by Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) scores. 15 These improvements persisted for at least 5 years and side effects were minimal. 14 Nevertheless, data obtained from prospective studies with more clinically realistic eligibility criteria than those de fi ned by previous RCTs can provide reassurance that these results can be duplicated in clinical practice, which often includes subjects with more severe disease.\nAfter Food and Drug Administration approval in 2010, the Post-FDA Approval Clinical Trial Evaluating BT in Severe Persistent Asthma (PAS2) was initiated. An interim analysis of data from the fi rst 190 PAS2 subjects con fi rmed previous reports that BT is safe and effective. 16 Although the PAS2 subjects were sicker than those in the AIR2 trial (94.7% of PAS2 subjects vs 82.1% of AIR2 subjects were classi fi ed with severe asthma based on the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society\n\n## ake-home Points\n\nStudy Question: What are the 5-year ef fi cacy and safety outcomes in people with severe asthma who have undergone bronchial thermoplasty (BT)? Results: Out of 284 subjects enrolled in the PostFDA Approval Clinical Trial Evaluating BT in Severe Persistent Asthma, 227 subjects (80%) completed 5 years of follow-up. By year 5 posttreatment, the proportion of these subjects with severe exacerbations, ED visits, and hospitalizations was 42.7%, 7.9%, and 4.8%, respectively, compared with 77.8%, 29.4%, and 16.1% in the 12 months prior to treatment. The proportion of subjects on maintenance oral corticosteroids decreased from 19.4% at baseline to 9.7% at 5 years. Subgroup analyses based on baseline clinical and biomarker characteristics revealed a statistically signi fi cant clinical improvement among all subgroups, including those based on eosinophil and neutrophil counts.\nInterpretation: Five years after treatment, subjects experienced decreases in severe exacerbations, hospitalizations, ED visits, and corticosteroid exposure, indicating clinically relevant improvements in asthma control. The subgroup analyses performed indicate BT may be a valuable add-on therapy for the treatment of subjects with severe asthma including those on oral corticosteroids and omalizumab. BT may also be a treatment option for people with severe asthma who cannot use or do not qualify for biological therapy for asthma (eg, those with noneosinophilic disease).\nBirmingham, AL; the St Joseph Medical Center (N.

PAS2 subjects had reduced rates of exacerbations, hospitalizations, and ED visits at 3 years post-BT compared with the 12 months prior to BT, indicating a consistent and durable treatment effect. This analysis also showed, for the fi rst time, that patients sustainably reduced asthma medication post-BT, including complete\ndiscontinuation of maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCSs) in a signi fi cant proportion of subjects.\nHere, we describe the clinical outcomes over 5 years after BT for the full cohort of 284 PAS2 subjects. Analyses of subgroups based on baseline clinical and biomarker characteristics were also performed to investigate potential correlations with responses to BT.\n\n## tudy Design and Methods Study Design\n\nThe PAS2 study design has been previously published. 16 PAS2 was a prospective, open-label, observational, multicenter clinical study to investigate the 5-year ef fi cacy and safety of BT. The study was approved by the ethics committee at each participating site, and all subjects signed an informed consent form prior to participation. The last subject exited the study in November 2019 after completing the 5-year follow-up visit.\n\n## tudy Subjects\n\nBetween 2011 and 2014, PAS2 enrolled subjects between 18 and 65 years of age whose asthma was inadequately controlled despite optimized treatment with high ICS and LABA doses (ICSs $ 1,000 m g/d [beclomethasone or equivalent] and LABAs $ 80 m g/ d [salmeterol or equivalent]). Subjects were allowed asthma medications in addition to ICSs and LABAs/short-acting betaagonists, including OCSs and/or omalizumab. Subjects diagnosed with other severe respiratory diseases were excluded. Other eligibility criteria for PAS2 have been previously described. 16\n\n## reatment\n\nBT treatments were administered using the Alair Bronchial Thermoplasty System (Boston Scienti fi c) per Food and Drug Administration labeling by the investigators as previously described. 14,15\n\n## ollow-up\n\nPAS2 subjects were evaluated 2 weeks after each of the fi rst 2 BT procedures and 6 weeks after the third (the end of the treatment period). Subjects were scheduled to be seen at annual in-person visits for 5 years after the BT treatments and by phone every 3 months between visits.\n\n## utcome Measures\n\nThe primary objective of PAS2 was to demonstrate the durability of treatment effect after BT. Severe asthma exacerbations, ED visits, and hospitalizations for respiratory symptoms during the 5 years after BT were compared with the respiratory events which occurred during the 12-month period prior to BT. Severe exacerbations were de fi ned as a worsening of asthma symptoms requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection; for further details, see Supplementary Methods 1 in e-Appendix 1). 17 Other outcome measures used in PAS2 have been previously described. 16\n\n## dverse Event Monitoring\n\nAdverse events were collected periprocedurally (de fi ned as the period beginning on the day of the fi rst BT procedure and ending 6 weeks after the last BT procedure) and at each follow-up visit in the posttreatment period. For further description of how adverse events were de fi ned, see Supplementary Methods 1 in e-Appendix 1.\n\n## tatistical Analyses\n\nBaseline demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes were summarized with sample size, mean, SD, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables and with proportions (numerator over denominator) for binary variables. To compare proportions, counts of events, and doses between baseline and years 1 through 5, the Fisher exact test, negative binomial test, and Student t test were used, respectively. For the subgroup analyses, a generalized linear model with binomial or negative binomial error distribution was fi t with factors of the subgroup, time, and interaction of subgroup and time; if the interaction had P < .10, contrasts of time within subgroup and subgroup within time were performed to explore differences. SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute) was used for all analyses.\n\n## aseline Demographics and Clinical Characteristics\n\nOf 284 subjects enrolled, 279 (mean age, 45.7 /C6 11.6 years) underwent BT as previously described, 16 and 227 (81%) subjects completed 5 years of follow-up (e-Figure 1).\nSubjects were 64.5% female with a mean BMI of 32.2 /C6 7.5 kg/m 2 and were 84% White, 9% Black or African heritage, and 7% from other racial groups. Subjects had a mean AQLQ score of 4.03 /C6 1.28, had asthma diagnosis on average 25.2 years prior to BT, and based on the European Respiratory Society/\nAmerican Thoracic Society Guidelines for Severe Asthma, 18 95% of subjects were considered to have severe asthma (Table 1).\nBaseline demographics were similar between the 227 subjects followed for 5 years and the 52 subjects who were not. A larger proportion of the subjects not followed for 5 years experienced severe exacerbations (92.3% vs 74.4%), ED visits (51.9% vs 24.2%), and hospitalizations (30.8% vs 12.8%) during the 12 months before BT compared with the 227 subjects followed for 5 years, respectively (Table 2). This indicates that the subjects who dropped out of PAS2 may have had more\n]\nsevere disease; therefore, some subjects with the most severe asthma were not included in the analysis.\n\n## evere Asthma Exacerbations, ED Visits, and Hospitalizations\n\nDuring the 12 months prior to BT, 77.8% of subjects experienced at least one severe exacerbation, compared with 50.4% after 1 year, 46.8% after 2 years, 47.0.% after 3 years, 44.2% after 4 years, and 42.7% after 5 years of follow-up ( P < .001) (Figure 1, Table 1). There was also a signi fi cant reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations from baseline (1.61 exacerbations/subject) to 5 years (0.72 exacerbations/subject; P < .001). There were 61.8% of subjects (68/110) with 1 or fewer severe exacerbations during the 12 months prior to BT who experienced 1 or fewer severe exacerbations per year after BT treatment compared with 35.0% of subjects (41/ 117) with 2 or more severe exacerbations during the 12 months prior to BT (Table 3).\nThe proportion of subjects with ED visits signi fi cantly decreased from 29.4% during the 12 months prior to BT to 18.3%, 14.7%, 13.0%, 11.7%, and 7.9% during\n(Continued)\nValues are mean /C6 SD or % (No. of patients).

ED visit rates were also reduced from 0.54 ED visits/subject in the 12 months prior to BT to 0.13 ED visits/subject in year 5 ( P 1\u20444 .0002). A decrease in hospitalizations was also observed after BT (Figure 1); 16.1% of subjects were hospitalized for asthma in the year prior to BT, but during years 1 through 5, only 8.0%, 7.5%, 7.3%, 3.3%, and 4.8%, respectively, were hospitalized ( P 1\u20444 .0003). Annual hospitalization rates fell from 0.22 hospitalizations/subject at baseline to\n0.06 hospitalizations/subject at year 5 after BT ( P 1\u20444 .0012).\nThe PAS2 data con fi rms reductions in these outcomes demonstrated in the AIR2 study (Figure 1).\n\n## pirometry\n\nSpirometry was performed at baseline and at yearly follow-up visits for all subjects. BT did not alter spirometric parameters as reported in previous studies 6,14,19,20 (e-Figure 2).\n\n## edication Usage\n\nPAS2 subjects reduced asthma maintenance medications. Notably, clinical improvements were accompanied by a reduction in corticosteroid exposure. The mean daily ICS dose of 2,272 m g/d (beclomethasone or equivalent) at baseline was sustainably reduced to 1,928 m g/d by year 5 post-BT (Table 4).\nThe percentage of subjects using biological medications for asthma control remained relatively constant (15.8%18.5%) over the course of the study (Table 4). At baseline, omalizumab was used exclusively. In subsequent years, some subjects began using mepolizumab, benralizumab, and reslizumab as these monoclonal antibodies were introduced (Table 4).\nAdditionally, 54 of 279 subjects (19.4%) were taking maintenance OCSs at the baseline visit. After BT treatment, 10.7%, 10.2%, 10.0%, 8.1%, and 9.7% of subjects were taking maintenance OCSs at the 1- to 5year follow-up visits, respectively (Table 4). Twenty-two of the 54 subjects (42%) taking OCSs at baseline discontinued OCSs after BT (Figure 2), and only six of these 22 subjects then used a biological medication. The proportion of subjects with severe exacerbations among those 22 fell from 95.5% at baseline to 50.0% at year 5 after BT treatment (Figure 2). In these subjects, BT not only reduced OCS exposure, but also severe exacerbations, ED visits, and hospitalizations.\nClinical improvements in the 32 subjects who continued taking OCS medications after BT were similar. In this case, 18of32subjectsalsousedabiologicalmedicationforasthma maintenance. The proportion of the 32 subjects experiencing severe exacerbations was reduced from 93.8% at baseline to 51.9% at year 5 after BT. These reductions in the proportion of subjects experiencing severe exacerbations were comparable with subjects who never used maintenance OCSs (73.3% experienced severe exacerbations at baseline vs 42.7% at year 5 after BT), even though patients using maintenance OCSs may have had more severe disease at baseline (Figure 2).\nOnly nine subjects who were not taking OCSs at baseline began taking these medications for asthma control after BT. These patients did not experience a reduction in severe exacerbations.\n\n## dverse Events\n\nBronchoscopic procedures can worsen asthma-related symptoms in the short term and induce other complications in people with severe asthma. 21-23 Although the percentage of subjects with periprocedural respiratory serious adverse events (requiring hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization) during the treatment phase was 14.7% (Table 5), respiratory serious adverse events were reduced during the posttreatment phase to 9.4% during year 1 after BT and to 4.7%duringyear5afterBT.Duringthisstudy,fourdeaths, all unrelated to BT, occurred. Two men, 50 and 55 years of age, died of cardiac arrest. The 55-year-old man was found unresponsive (pulseless and asystolic) at home approximately 3 years after the third BT procedure. The 50-year-old man died of cardiac arrest shortly after completing the third BT treatment. A 57-year-old woman died of myocardial infarction approximately 2 years after the fi nal BT treatment after cardiac catheterization/ stenting for severe arterial stenoses failed. A 53-year-old mandiedapproximately3yearsafterhislastBTprocedure of unknown causes. This subject had severe OSA and died in his sleep; no autopsy was performed.\n\n## ubgroup Analysis\n\nWe analyzed subgroups of subjects to see if BT was effective in reducing severe exacerbations, ED visits, and hospitalizations. Subgroups included the following: sex, age ( < 40 and $ 40 years), BMI ( < 30 and $ 30 kg/m 2 ), baseline AQLQ score ( < 4.0 and $ 4.0), baseline OCS use (yes and no), baseline omalizumab use (yes and no), and complete activations ( # 140 and > 140). We also analyzed subgroups based on baseline prebronchodilator FEV1/FVC ( # 70% and > 70%), and bronchodilator reversibility ( fi xed or reversible), 24 and baseline blood\nSubjects included the 227 patients with a 5-year follow-up.

There were no differences in\nsubgroups based on both baseline blood eosinophil and neutrophil counts (Figure 4). Subjects with eosinophil counts of # 150 cells/ m L had consistently higher percentages of subjects experiencing hospitalizations than subjects with eosinophil counts > 150 cells/ m L in the 12 months before and in the years after BT treatment. Subjects with neutrophil counts # 5,000 cells/ m L had consistently lower percentages of severe exacerbations than subjects with neutrophil counts >\n5,000 cells/ m L in the years after BT treatment, but not during the 12 months before BT (Figs 4B, 4C).\n\n## iscussion\n\nWith 284 patients enrolled, PAS2 is the largest study to date designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of BT and the durability of treatment effect in subjects with poorly controlled asthma despite treatment with the\n]\ncurrent standard of care. Previous clinical trials of BT (AIR, AIR2, and Research in Severe Asthma [RISA]) have shown that the procedure is safe and effective, but subjects enrolled in these clinical trials may not be representative of the most severe asthma cases considered for BT in clinical practice. For example, the AIR2 RCT excluded patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, interstitial lung disease, chronic sinus disease, OSA, and other common comorbidities found in people with asthma, but the PAS2 allowed participation of subjects with these conditions. Publications have reported on BT in people with more severe asthma that were older and had worse baseline lung function and quality of life. 4,6-8,28 These data indicated a clinical improvement post-BT in these subjects and acceptable rates of adverse events. Additionally, Chaudhuri et al 29 recently reported that the clinical improvements after BT can last for $ 10 years after treatment in some subjects. PAS2 adds to the body of evidence demonstrating the long-term safety and effectiveness of BT outside the setting of RCTs.\nAlthough PAS2 is a single-arm study, the fi ndings are important and con fi rm previously published interim results in this population, 16 indicating that clinically relevant improvements in asthma control (particularly signi fi cant reductions in severe exacerbations) are sustainable to 5 years of follow-up.\nThe people with severe asthma in PAS2 had relatively well-preserved pulmonary function (FEV1 in the 75%80% range). 30 People with asthma, particularly those with severe asthma, experience a progressive decline in lung function as measured by FEV1 with time (22.550 mL/y). Subjects who experience more severe exacerbations per year tend to exhibit a more rapid decline in FEV1. 30-33 As shown in previous publications, 14-16 there is no signi fi cant decline in FEV1 and FVC up to 5 years after BT, highlighting the longterm safety of the BT procedure.\nIn PAS2, 14.7% of subjects experienced procedurerelated serious adverse events during the treatment period. This was slightly higher than in previously reported trials of BT, 14,34 perhaps because of enrollment of subjects with more severe asthma and more comorbidities in PAS2. The most common periprocedural respiratory serious adverse event was asthma aggravation (77.8%), due in part to the length of the bronchoscopic procedure required and/or the thermal injury sustained during the procedure. Although hospitalization was required for all\nperiprocedural respiratory serious adverse events, intubation and/or mechanical ventilation was reported in only four cases, two because of hemoptysis. One occurred 1 week after the second BT treatment; the subject was intubated, underwent bronchoscopy to suction a blood clot, and had the third BT treatment. The second occurred 1 month after the third BT procedure; the subject was intubated, an embolization procedure was performed, and the subject completed follow-up. A third subject experienced vocal cord spasm 30 min after the fi rst BT treatment and required intubation until the spasm resolved; the subject recovered but did not undergo further BT treatments. The last subject experienced an asthma exacerbation requiring intubation in the ED 1 day after the second BT treatment; the subject recovered and completed the third BT treatment, but withdrew before the 3-year follow-up.\nPAS2 subjects were able to reduce exposure to corticosteroid medications, particularly OCSs, after BT. Forty-two percent of subjects on OCSs were able to completely discontinue them after BT treatment while simultaneously improving asthma control. This is encouraging because daily use of OCSs is associated with signi fi cant side effects and negative impact on quality of life. 35 This suggests that BT should be considered as a treatment option for patients who are taking systemic corticosteroids and are experiencing or concerned about these side effects. 36\nAlthough we were unable to identify a speci fi c subgroup of patients in which BT was most effective using baseline data, BT was effective in all subgroups, including subjects with both fi xed and reversible airways and both high and low eosinophil counts. Interestingly, patients with low blood eosinophil counts responded favorably to BT, suggesting that BT can be considered as a treatment option for patients that are not candidates for a biological therapy. 37,38\nOne limitation of the PAS2 study was that it did not include a sham or control group, and the effect of closer follow-up of patients in the setting of a clinical study on potential medication reductions and improvement in asthma control cannot be ruled out. Another limitation is that, as in all open-label extension studies, the subjects who were not followed for the entire 5-year period tended to be people with more severe asthma with worse prognosis, which introduced bias. Although changes in quality of life scores (AQLQ) would have been useful to present, AQLQ scores were only collected at baseline in PAS2 and we were unable to analyze the effect BT had\nthem. The PAS2 subjects were heterogeneous in terms of asthma phenotype, and the subgroup analysis based on asthma phenotype was post hoc and based on counts of blood eosinophils and neutrophils taken at baseline for a subset of subjects. However, it has been hypothesized that sputum cellular pro fi les may be a more accurate measure of the type of in fl ammation occurring in the airways because blood counts of eosinophils and neutrophils may not always correlate perfectly with sputum cellular pro fi les. 37 This limited our ability to accurately phenotype the subjects. Studies in which asthma phenotype is more clearly de fi ned are required to determine whether certain types of asthma respond better to BT. Finally, because we did not compare responses after BT to responses to biological medications, it is not known whether the response to biological medications in this study population would have been more pronounced than the response to BT. It is possible that because biological medications selectively target proin fl ammatory pathways, and BT largely acts on processes involved in airway remodeling, the two\ntreatments could be complementary in people with severe asthma with evidence of both airway in fl ammation and airway remodeling. We did observe that BT was safe and improved clinical outcomes regardless of whether or not biological medications, including those targeting IL-5, were initiated after treatment (data not shown); however, we recognize that the PAS2 study was not controlled and that the asthma treatment landscape is shifting, which is a challenge for all trials involving this disease.\n\n## nterpretation\n\nFive years after treatment, PAS2 subjects experienced decreases in severe exacerbations, hospitalizations, ED visits, and corticosteroid exposure. Subgroup analyses suggested that BT improves asthma control in different asthma phenotypes. BT may be a valuable add-on therapy for the treatment of severe asthma. It may also be a treatment option for people with severe asthma who do not qualify for biological therapy.\n]\n\n## cknowledgments\n\nAuthor contributions: G.

Olson, PhD; and Michel Laviolette, MD\nBACKGROUND: Bronchial thermoplasty is a device-based treatment for subjects $ 18 years of age\nwith severe asthma poorly controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists. The Post-FDA Approval Clinical Trial Evaluating Bronchial Thermoplasty in Severe Persistent Asthma (PAS2) study collected data on patients with severe asthma undergoing this procedure.\nRESEARCH QUESTION: What are the 5-year ef fi cacy and safety results in patients with severe asthma who have undergone bronchial thermoplasty?\nSTUDYDESIGNANDMETHODS: This was a prospective, open-label, observational, multicenter study conducted in the United States and Canada. Subjects 18 to 65 years of age who were taking inhaled corticosteroids $ 1,000 m g/d (beclomethasone or equivalent) and long-acting beta-agonists $ 80 m g/d (salmeterol or equivalent) were included. Severe exacerbations, hospitalization, ED visits, and medication usage were evaluated for the 12 months prior to and at years 1 through 5 posttreatment. Spirometry was evaluated at baseline and at years 1 through 5 posttreatment.\nRESULTS: A total of 284 subjects were enrolled at 27 centers; 227 subjects (80%) completed 5 years of follow-up. By year 5 posttreatment, the proportion of subjects with severe exacerbations, ED visits, and hospitalizations was 42.7%, 7.9%, and 4.8%, respectively, compared with 77.8%, 29.4%, and 16.1% in the 12 months prior to treatment. The proportion of subjects on maintenance oral corticosteroids decreased from 19.4% at baseline to 9.7% at 5 years. Analyses of subgroups based on baseline clinical and biomarker characteristics revealed a statistically signi fi cant clinical improvement among all subgroups.\nINTERPRETATION: Five years after treatment, subjects experienced decreases in severe exacerbations, hospitalizations, ED visits, and corticosteroid exposure. All subgroups demonstrated clinically signi fi cant improvement, suggesting that bronchial thermoplasty improves asthma control in different asthma phenotypes.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT01350336; URL: www. clinicaltrials.gov CHEST 2022; 161(3):614-628\nKEY WORDS: asthma subgroups; bronchial thermoplasty; corticosteroid exposure; severe asthma; severe exacerbations\nABBREVIATIONS: AIR = Asthma Intervention Research; AIR2 = Asthma Intervention Research 2; AQLQ = Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire; BT = bronchial thermoplasty; ICS = inhaled corticosteroid; LABA = long-acting beta-agonist; OCS = oral corticosteroid; PAS2 = Post-FDA Approval Clinical Trial Evaluating BT in Severe Persistent Asthma; RCT = randomized controlled trial\nAFFILIATIONS: From Yale University (G.

Ten percent of patients have severe, poorly controlled disease despite optimal medical therapy. These patients account for > 80% of asthma-related health care costs. 1-3\nBronchial thermoplasty (BT) is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved procedure for the treatment of asthma. It is indicated for patients $ 18 years of age with severe persistent asthma not well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and long-acting betaagonists (LABAs). BT uses radiofrequency energy to heat the airway walls in a controlled manner. The mechanism of action is attributed to a reduction in airway smooth muscle mass after the procedure. 4-9 Reduction in airway smooth muscle has been associated with clinical improvement seen in patients undergoing BT. 5,6 Other structural and immunohistologic changes after BT, including reduction in reticular basement membrane thickness, reduction in collagen type I deposition, and changes in neuroendocrine cells, may also contribute to clinical improvement. 4,6,10,11\nSeveral randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of BT have been carried out in subjects with moderate to severe asthma, including the Asthma Intervention Research (AIR), Research in Severe Asthma (RISA), and Asthma Intervention Research 2 (AIR2) studies. 12-15 These studies demonstrated improvements in asthma control after BT, including decreased numbers of asthma exacerbations, ED visits, and hospitalizations. In addition, subjects experienced improved quality of life as measured by Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) scores. 15 These improvements persisted for at least 5 years and side effects were minimal. 14 Nevertheless, data obtained from prospective studies with more clinically realistic eligibility criteria than those de fi ned by previous RCTs can provide reassurance that these results can be duplicated in clinical practice, which often includes subjects with more severe disease.\nAfter Food and Drug Administration approval in 2010, the Post-FDA Approval Clinical Trial Evaluating BT in Severe Persistent Asthma (PAS2) was initiated. An interim analysis of data from the fi rst 190 PAS2 subjects con fi rmed previous reports that BT is safe and effective. 16 Although the PAS2 subjects were sicker than those in the AIR2 trial (94.7% of PAS2 subjects vs 82.1% of AIR2 subjects were classi fi ed with severe asthma based on the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society",

Results: Out of 284 subjects enrolled in the PostFDA Approval Clinical Trial Evaluating BT in Severe Persistent Asthma, 227 subjects (80%) completed 5 years of follow-up. By year 5 posttreatment, the proportion of these subjects with severe exacerbations, ED visits, and hospitalizations was 42.7%, 7.9%, and 4.8%, respectively, compared with 77.8%, 29.4%, and 16.1% in the 12 months prior to treatment. The proportion of subjects on maintenance oral corticosteroids decreased from 19.4% at baseline to 9.7% at 5 years. Subgroup analyses based on baseline clinical and biomarker characteristics revealed a statistically signi fi cant clinical improvement among all subgroups, including those based on eosinophil and neutrophil counts.\nInterpretation: Five years after treatment, subjects experienced decreases in severe exacerbations, hospitalizations, ED visits, and corticosteroid exposure, indicating clinically relevant improvements in asthma control. The subgroup analyses performed indicate BT may be a valuable add-on therapy for the treatment of subjects with severe asthma including those on oral corticosteroids and omalizumab. BT may also be a treatment option for people with severe asthma who cannot use or do not qualify for biological therapy for asthma (eg, those with noneosinophilic disease).\nBirmingham, AL; the St Joseph Medical Center (N.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "With 284 patients enrolled, PAS2 is the largest study to date designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of BT and the durability of treatment effect in subjects with poorly controlled asthma despite treatment with the\n]\ncurrent standard of care. Previous clinical trials of BT (AIR, AIR2, and Research in Severe Asthma [RISA]) have shown that the procedure is safe and effective, but subjects enrolled in these clinical trials may not be representative of the most severe asthma cases considered for BT in clinical practice. For example, the AIR2 RCT excluded patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, interstitial lung disease, chronic sinus disease, OSA, and other common comorbidities found in people with asthma, but the PAS2 allowed participation of subjects with these conditions. Publications have reported on BT in people with more severe asthma that were older and had worse baseline lung function and quality of life. 4,6-8,28 These data indicated a clinical improvement post-BT in these subjects and acceptable rates of adverse events. Additionally, Chaudhuri et al 29 recently reported that the clinical improvements after BT can last for $ 10 years after treatment in some subjects. PAS2 adds to the body of evidence demonstrating the long-term safety and effectiveness of BT outside the setting of RCTs.\nAlthough PAS2 is a single-arm study, the fi ndings are important and con fi rm previously published interim results in this population, 16 indicating that clinically relevant improvements in asthma control (particularly signi fi cant reductions in severe exacerbations) are sustainable to 5 years of follow-up.\nThe people with severe asthma in PAS2 had relatively well-preserved pulmonary function (FEV1 in the 75%80% range). 30 People with asthma, particularly those with severe asthma, experience a progressive decline in lung function as measured by FEV1 with time (22.550 mL/y). Subjects who experience more severe exacerbations per year tend to exhibit a more rapid decline in FEV1. 30-33 As shown in previous publications, 14-16 there is no signi fi cant decline in FEV1 and FVC up to 5 years after BT, highlighting the longterm safety of the BT procedure.\nIn PAS2, 14.7% of subjects experienced procedurerelated serious adverse events during the treatment period. This was slightly higher than in previously reported trials of BT, 14,34 perhaps because of enrollment of subjects with more severe asthma and more comorbidities in PAS2. The most common periprocedural respiratory serious adverse event was asthma aggravation (77.8%), due in part to the length of the bronchoscopic procedure required and/or the thermal injury sustained during the procedure. Although hospitalization was required for all\nperiprocedural respiratory serious adverse events, intubation and/or mechanical ventilation was reported in only four cases, two because of hemoptysis. One occurred 1 week after the second BT treatment; the subject was intubated, underwent bronchoscopy to suction a blood clot, and had the third BT treatment. The second occurred 1 month after the third BT procedure; the subject was intubated, an embolization procedure was performed, and the subject completed follow-up. A third subject experienced vocal cord spasm 30 min after the fi rst BT treatment and required intubation until the spasm resolved; the subject recovered but did not undergo further BT treatments. The last subject experienced an asthma exacerbation requiring intubation in the ED 1 day after the second BT treatment; the subject recovered and completed the third BT treatment, but withdrew before the 3-year follow-up.\nPAS2 subjects were able to reduce exposure to corticosteroid medications, particularly OCSs, after BT. Forty-two percent of subjects on OCSs were able to completely discontinue them after BT treatment while simultaneously improving asthma control. This is encouraging because daily use of OCSs is associated with signi fi cant side effects and negative impact on quality of life. 35 This suggests that BT should be considered as a treatment option for patients who are taking systemic corticosteroids and are experiencing or concerned about these side effects. 36\nAlthough we were unable to identify a speci fi c subgroup of patients in which BT was most effective using baseline data, BT was effective in all subgroups, including subjects with both fi xed and reversible airways and both high and low eosinophil counts. Interestingly, patients with low blood eosinophil counts responded favorably to BT, suggesting that BT can be considered as a treatment option for patients that are not candidates for a biological therapy. 37,38\nOne limitation of the PAS2 study was that it did not include a sham or control group, and the effect of closer follow-up of patients in the setting of a clinical study on potential medication reductions and improvement in asthma control cannot be ruled out. Another limitation is that, as in all open-label extension studies, the subjects who were not followed for the entire 5-year period tended to be people with more severe asthma with worse prognosis, which introduced bias. Although changes in quality of life scores (AQLQ) would have been useful to present, AQLQ scores were only collected at baseline in PAS2 and we were unable to analyze the effect BT had\nthem. The PAS2 subjects were heterogeneous in terms of asthma phenotype, and the subgroup analysis based on asthma phenotype was post hoc and based on counts of blood eosinophils and neutrophils taken at baseline for a subset of subjects. However, it has been hypothesized that sputum cellular pro fi les may be a more accurate measure of the type of in fl ammation occurring in the airways because blood counts of eosinophils and neutrophils may not always correlate perfectly with sputum cellular pro fi les. 37 This limited our ability to accurately phenotype the subjects. Studies in which asthma phenotype is more clearly de fi ned are required to determine whether certain types of asthma respond better to BT. Finally, because we did not compare responses after BT to responses to biological medications, it is not known whether the response to biological medications in this study population would have been more pronounced than the response to BT. It is possible that because biological medications selectively target proin fl ammatory pathways, and BT largely acts on processes involved in airway remodeling, the two\ntreatments could be complementary in people with severe asthma with evidence of both airway in fl ammation and airway remodeling. We did observe that BT was safe and improved clinical outcomes regardless of whether or not biological medications, including those targeting IL-5, were initiated after treatment (data not shown); however, we recognize that the PAS2 study was not controlled and that the asthma treatment landscape is shifting, which is a challenge for all trials involving this disease.",
