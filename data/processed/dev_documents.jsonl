{"id": "3D printing for airway disease", "title": "3D printing for airway disease", "abstract": "It has been 30 years since the first commercial three-dimensional (3D) printer was available on market. The technological advancement of 3D printing has far exceeded its implementation in medicine. The application of 3D printing technology has the potential of playing a major role within interventional pulmonology; specifically, in the management of complex airway disease. Tailoring management to the patient-specific anatomical malformation caused by benign or malignant disease is a major challenge faced by interventional pulmonologists. Such cases often require adjunctive therapeutic procedures with thermal therapies followed by dilation and airway stenting to maintain the patency of the airway. Airway-stent size matching is one key to reducing stent-related complications. A major barrier to matching is the expansion of the stent in two dimensions (fixed sizes in length and diameter) within the deformed airway. Additional challenges are created by the subjective oversizing of the stent to reduce the likelihood of migration. Improper sizing adversely affects the stability of the stent. The stent-airway mismatch can be complicated by airway erosion, perforation, or the formation of granulation tissue. Stents can migrate, fracture, obstruct, or become infected. The use of patient-specific 3D printed airway stents may be able to reduce the stent airway mismatch. These stents allow more precise stent-airway sizing and minimizes high-pressure points on distorted airway anatomy. In theory, this should reduce the incidence of the well-known complications of factory manufactured stents. In this article, the authors present the brief history of 3D printed stents, their consideration in select patients, processing steps for development, and future direction.", "content": "## istory of three-dimensional (3D) airway stenting\n\nThe birthplace of the silicone airway stent was Marseille, France in 1987 (1). Silicone stents were deployed via rigid bronchoscopy and came in different shapes (bronchial, tracheal, tracheobronchial Y, and hourglass) and sizes. This followed with the adaptation of self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) from the gastroenterology and their subsequent use within the tracheobronchial tree. Over the past few years, stent technology has rapidly matured. Advancements in biomedical engineering have given rise\nto patient-specific 3D printed stents (PS3DS). Although new stents are regularly introduced to the existing market, a 'universally accepted' stent has yet to be developed (2). Like fingerprints, no two tracheobronchial diseases manifest alike, and the airway has dynamic motion with inspiration, expiration, and cough. Due to these intricacies, mass manufactured stents may not be the ideal solution for all patients or even groups of patients. Precision medicine focuses on optimizing efficiency or therapeutic benefit for a particular group of patients; it is being heavily researched in the disciplines of cardiology and oncology (3,4). Patient-\n\n## irway anatomy\n\nA tracheobronchial tree is unique for each person. It varies based on the age, gender, and height of an individual. Normal tracheal diameter ranges from 16-20 millimeters (mm) and the length 10-14 centimeters (cm). The trachea has a unique 'D' shape on a cross-section with a flat membranous posterior wall and a cartilaginous anterior arch. The right main bronchus length is shorter than the left main bronchus (1.5 vs. 4.5 cm). This is due to the more proximal take off the right upper lobe in comparison to the left upper lobe. Both main bronchi range between 8-12 mm in diameter. As no two tracheobronchial trees are exactly alike, it is challenging to find a perfectly matching tracheobronchial stent when disease can alter all the dimensions differently.\nPatient-specific 3D printed airway stents are typically considered in complex airway disorders, which are a heterogeneous group of pathologies. Airway narrowing or obstruction can produce a variety of respiratory symptoms\nthat can range from mild respiratory distress to profound respiratory failure and death.\nThe compromise of airways can be due to benign or malignant processes. Examples of benign pathology include subglottic stenosis (post-intubation or due to inflammatory disorders such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis or sarcoidosis), tracheal or bronchial stenosis, tracheobronchomalacia, excessive dynamic airway collapse, non-malignant fistulas (tracheoesophageal, bronchoesophageal, or bronchopleural), or anastomotic complications amongst lung transplantation recipients (5).\nMalignancy related airway obstruction can occur in primary lung cancer as well as metastatic disease (breast cancer, colon cancer, sarcoma, melanoma, renal cell cancer, etc.). Malignant airway obstruction can arise due to extrinsic compression, endobronchial obstruction, or a combination of both processes (6).\n\n## urrent airway stenting practice patterns\n\nManagement of diseases compromising the tracheobronchial tree is highly viable and predicated on several factors: local practice pattern, equipment availability, operator preference and experience, etc. Often, treatment mandates frequent airway evaluation with bronchoscopy and interventions to recapture the airway such as sequential balloon dilation, mechanical debulking, non-mechanical debulking with a variety of tools (thermal, laser, or cryotherapy-based ablation modalities), and stent placement for airway stabilization. The stent plays the role of airway maintenance to enable proper ventilation of the lung parenchyma beyond the stricture in malignant airway disease and to enable proper healing with minimization of the narrowed area of the airway in a benign airway disease. Stent matching of the malformed anatomy is critical to minimize the friction effect between the stent and the mucosa. Undue friction can to granulation tissue formation, and subsequent restenosis. Interventional pulmonologists have been facing complex airway disease and implanting various tracheobronchial stents for decades. In current practice, silicone and SEMS are the two main groups of airway prostheses. Both can achieve airway patency and maintain ventilation of the lung parenchyma for a time. Without a precise fit into the area, complications can arise with either type of stent: plugging with or without concurrent infection ( Figure 1 ), metal fatigue leading to fracture ( Figure 2 ), migration ( Figure 3 ), formation of granulation tissue ( Figure 4 ), and mucosal incorporation with possible erosion and perforation ( Figure 5 ) (7).\nSilicone stents and SEMS have individual advantages and disadvantages ( Table 1 ). There are a number of biophysical interactions that can have an adverse effect on the stentairway interface. Self-expanding metallic stents are not static in size. Their lengths can change under compression through a phenomenon known as foreshortening. Coughing can cause mucosal trauma from the movement of wire edges which eventually can lead to granulation tissue formation (8).\nSuboptimal pressure distribution can also cause damage to airway mucosa by impeding microcirculation and fibroblast proliferation (9). In some cases, the unequal pressure can lead to mucosal erosion and associated airway perforation.\nScar tissue and tumor respond differently to the expandable pressure generated by dilation of a stent. A stenosis may reopen easily with an expansile force but may not be able to resist compression due to adjacent tumor growth, this phenomenon is seen usually when balloon bronchoplasty is applied at the narrowed airway. Following dilation of the airway, there is a tendency to re-collapse due to external pressure from an extraluminal mass. This balance of viscoelastic factors is a complex, but an important interaction between the stent and the airway.\nThe silicone stent is cheaper when compared SEMS. Typically, they come in straight and Y varieties. The Y silicone stent is more predisposed to mucus build up, which can lead to plugging and infection. Straight silicone stents are more likely migrate when compared to their metallic counterparts (10). Due to its configuration, the Y silicone stent tends to migrate less when compared to their straight counterparts. For proper maintenance, silicone stents typically require, medication to help with mucus clearance, frequent surveillance bronchoscopies with stent revision (11,12).\nDue to the materials used for production and the manufacturing process, SEMS are more expensive. When deployed, these stents expand within the airway. The expansive force must be optimized to reduce the risk of complications. T oo much expansive radial force can cause tissue injury due to mucosal ischemia, while too little (or too much) can lead to stent migration (13). Metal fatigue and stent metal fragmentation are not uncommon phenomena (7,12). Stent deployment must be performed with care as the SEMS can follow the path of least resistance (nonstenotic airway segment) rather than staying engaged in the stenotic area ( Figure 3 ).\nAlthough the SEMS that are currently available on the market comes in a variety of sizes, the problem of size mismatching between tracheobronchial is still encountered by many interventional pulmonologists (2). One of the options is to customize manufactured silicone stents to accommodate with the airway anatomy. These adjustments include cutting the silicone stent to fit the airway narrowing and avoid coverage of the main lobar outlets, using intussusception technique to extend the stent length to cover a larger area of stenosis (14), and suturing two different types of silicone stents together (Y stent and\n\nbronchial straight stent) to better approximate the size and length of the main bronchus ( Figure 6 ). While these techniques are somewhat effective, they fail to achieve the desired degree of precision for stent-airway size matching.\n\n## airway stent printing\n\nIn response to the limitations of commercially available stents, alternative methods of airway stent manufacturing such as custom 3D stent printing are being considered. The pioneers of 3D printing include Dr. Kodama, Charles Hull, and Charles Deckard. The application of 3D printing in medicine is not a novel concept. The medical industry accounts for over a quarter of the applications of 3D printing amongst various fields (15). Initially used for prototyping, 3D printing is now used to manufacture prosthesis, instruments, implants, and artificial organs for research purposes. With the right equipment and expertise, 3D printing can allow point-of-care fabrication of customized implants, including airway stents.\nIt must be kept in mind that the variability of build processes and high degree of customizability pose challenges to meeting regulatory standards and quality assurance (16). Conventional design validation for custom 3D printed airway stents is both labor and cost intensive. As an alternative, finite element analysis (FEA) can be used to predict the mechanical performance of a virtual device model (17). The use of FEA avoids the sacrifice of the printed device that would occur during conventional mechanical testing. The acceptance of conventional design validation by FEA has not been expressed by the United\nStates Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) (16). At present, very little guidance exists for quality assurance of 3D printed implantable devices.\nThere are several key post-printing processes that are essential to the creation of any 3D printed medical device. Post-manufacturing processing is needed for any 3D printed stent. The method and materials used are dependent on the printing process that was utilized. Tumblers, sandblasting, or air-blasting may be needed. The International Organization of Standards (ISO) has published their standards for assessment of biocompatibility of medical devices, ISO 10993 (18). This 68-page document outlines the regulatory standards that must be followed for any device that will be directly or indirectly making contact with the body. Airway stents are considered class III devices by the USFDA (19). For class III devices, the USFDA has adopted and enforced the ISO recommendations.\nSterilization is also an important process that cannot be overlooked with 3D printing. The probability of a single unit being non-sterile after it has undergone sterilization is known as the sterility assurance level (SAL). The material used for printing, the availability of sterilization processes, and the interaction between the sterilization process and the printed material dictate the type of process used. The melting point of some printing materials (such as PCL) is below the temperature of conventional sterilization processes such as steam and ethylene oxide gas. A consensus strategy for the validation of sterility is yet to be developed. At present, the USFDA is also considering sterilization and subsequent reuse of 3D printed implantable medical devices (16). Whether such\nprocesses will be approved is yet to be determined; their applicability to PS3DS will likely be limited due to the patient-specific nature of the stent design.\n\n## printing process\n\nPresently, the majority of 3D printing within medicine is for creating surgical guides and surgical planning (20). The application of 3D printing for custom implants (including airway stents) is still in its infancy. 3D printers have undergone significant enhancements in the current century. Unfortunately, there has been a delay in implementing this technology in pulmonary medicine; specifically, in the realm of PS3DS. A major barrier that contributed to this delay was the inability of the end-user (i.e., an interventional pulmonologist) to easily create a platform for the design and manufacturing of a PS3DS. Another bottleneck has been finding the optimal printing material that allows for easy deployment within the airway and counteracts luminal pressure to maintain airway patency.\nThe current technology used in 3D printing are the stereolithography, selective laser sintering (SLS), MultiJet modeling, and fused deposition modeling. The procedural details and materials needed vary from method to method. The US Food and Drug Administration approved multiple materials for medical 3D printing: polycaprolactone (PCL),\npolylactic acid (PLA), and poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA). These materials can be used alone or combined together to manufacture the final product. The mechanical characteristics of the printed device depend on the mixture ratio of PLA and PLGA. In addition to biocompatibility, both materials are biodegradable (21).\nDuring the initial steps, CT subtraction imaging is used to create the platform for the prototype that will be used in the 3D printer. The CT chest imaging is used to create a 3D virtual model by calculating a centerline for the patient airway. Using this as a platform, the interventional pulmonologist is able to form a PS3DS ( Figure 7 ).\nThe build of the 3D prototype starts by subtracting the data from the CT chest images and generating an image structure segmentation as digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM). The DICOM file is then converted to a standard tessellation language (STL) file generated by a computer-aided design program. The STL file can be used by the 3D printer to design the stent into several layers that range between 0.005 to 0.013 mm in thickness.\nThe costs of PS3DS can also vary widely. Overhead costs include the printer itself and the materials used for development of the prosthesis. Overall, the price per stent is difficult to estimate due to the wide variance of the costs for the process as a whole: printer, printing material,\nimaging, practice prints, designing software, computer, and dedicated time. It is yet to be determined if PS3DS is a cost-effective option.\n\n## printing landscape in present day\n\nWhen compared to other subspecialties, interventional pulmonology in its adolescence. If plotted on the same time scale, the use of PS3DS in complex major airway disease is still in its infancy. Clinical trials do not exist, and long-term outcome data is years away. The current data regarding PS3DS is limited to a small number of case reports.\nThe first published use of an airway PS3DS was in France. A PS3DS was used successfully in a patient with a complete stenosis of their bronchus intermedius with partial dehiscence of the bronchial anastomosis in their lung allograft (22). The patient in the study reported an immediate improvement in symptoms, there were no reported complications. Gildea and colleagues were the first to use a PS3DS in a human being. They later published their one-year experience with PS3DS in two patients with airway disease due to granulomatosis with polyangiitis (23); the report was the first of its kind in the United States. Both stents were removed after one year in order to deviation\nfrom standard of care with silicone stones and to comply with the obtained USFDA compassionate use exemption. Most recently, two silicone Y PS3DS were developed and implanted via a collaboration between physicians in Austria and the United States (24). Although not technically an airway stent, a 3D printed airway splint has been created and used in severe tracheobronchomalacia of infancy (25). Overall, there is a large gap in medical literature pertaining to PS3DS. There is no published outcome comparison data between PS3DS and standard airway stents (26).\n\n## uture directions\n\nWith biomedical engineering evolving at a rapid rate, we anticipate the use of PS3DS to become more widespread. Technological advancement will make printing more widely available, faster, and cheaper. Patient-specific short tracheal cannulas can be developed from data from derived purely from imaging (27). We anticipate that with continued improvement with imaging and printing, PS3DS will be able to be printed to match the patient's airway with extreme precision. Work is being undertaken to better optimize the stent-airway interaction with PS3DS. The ability to predict and test forces of the adjacent airway on the stent itself would be a major advancement in the field. A group from Spain has proposed a system of computer-based mathematical optimization of a stent. Unfortunately, it is not sustainable due to the high demand on processing power and expertise. Mitigation of infection risk with PS3DS is another arena of research. A variety of methods have been proposed, but their feasibility and ability to gain approval by regulatory bodies remains in question: bactericidal agent incorporation into the printing material or stent coating, combination of hot fused filament techniques or injection mold technique with a wet printing or electrospinning, and incorporation of antibiotics into polymers (28).\nTo add another facet of complexity, the development of drug eluting stents is possible and has some potential advantages: reduction of granulation tissue formation and inhibition of tumor ingrowth. At this juncture, manufacturing is technically feasible, but it would be fraught with regulatory challenges. Once a drug is embedded, any stent is seen as a pharmaceutical product and not an implantable medical device (29). This would open the stent to the rigorous and more robust regulatory procedures faced by pharmaceutical products, and not simply a medical device.\nAirway stents are rarely implanted with the intention\nof being permanent. Biodegradable stents are currently available for use in the cardiovascular system (30). In the future, it is possible that similar technology may cross over into pulmonary medicine. Freitag and colleagues are developing and testing biodegradable airway stents in animal models (28). For optimal effect, the degradation time constants of these stents have to be well-studied as erratic and unpredictable dissolution can have adverse impacts on the airway. The consideration of their use is several years away.\nIn summary, PS3DS within the tracheobronchial tree are not yet ready for prime time. They are only being considered in the cases of compassionate use and are pending prospective studies. Further research is needed to assess their efficacy, safety, and practical feasibility. Their biggest advantage is the ability to be tailored specifically to a lesion in a patient's airway. Although the early clinical experience is promising and the employed technology is exciting, the clinical value proposition is yet to be discerned in comparative clinical trials.\n\n## cknowledgements\n\nFunding : NIH-NCAI grant support (grant 1U54HL119810-03).\n\n## ootnote\n\nConflicts of Interest: Cleveland Clinic and Cleveland Clinic Institutional Officials/Leaders have an equity interest in Custom Orthopaedic Solutions and are entitled to royalty payments from the company for technology developed at Cleveland Clinic.

For proper maintenance, silicone stents typically require, medication to help with mucus clearance, frequent surveillance bronchoscopies with stent revision (11,12).\nDue to the materials used for production and the manufacturing process, SEMS are more expensive. When deployed, these stents expand within the airway. The expansive force must be optimized to reduce the risk of complications. T oo much expansive radial force can cause tissue injury due to mucosal ischemia, while too little (or too much) can lead to stent migration (13). Metal fatigue and stent metal fragmentation are not uncommon phenomena (7,12). Stent deployment must be performed with care as the SEMS can follow the path of least resistance (nonstenotic airway segment) rather than staying engaged in the stenotic area ( Figure 3 ).\nAlthough the SEMS that are currently available on the market comes in a variety of sizes, the problem of size mismatching between tracheobronchial is still encountered by many interventional pulmonologists (2). One of the options is to customize manufactured silicone stents to accommodate with the airway anatomy. These adjustments include cutting the silicone stent to fit the airway narrowing and avoid coverage of the main lobar outlets, using intussusception technique to extend the stent length to cover a larger area of stenosis (14), and suturing two different types of silicone stents together (Y stent and", "category": "other", "level": null, "page_start": null, "page_end": null, "section_id": null}, {"title": "", "content": "bronchial straight stent) to better approximate the size and length of the main bronchus ( Figure 6 ).

The pioneers of 3D printing include Dr. Kodama, Charles Hull, and Charles Deckard. The application of 3D printing in medicine is not a novel concept. The medical industry accounts for over a quarter of the applications of 3D printing amongst various fields (15). Initially used for prototyping, 3D printing is now used to manufacture prosthesis, instruments, implants, and artificial organs for research purposes. With the right equipment and expertise, 3D printing can allow point-of-care fabrication of customized implants, including airway stents.\nIt must be kept in mind that the variability of build processes and high degree of customizability pose challenges to meeting regulatory standards and quality assurance (16). Conventional design validation for custom 3D printed airway stents is both labor and cost intensive. As an alternative, finite element analysis (FEA) can be used to predict the mechanical performance of a virtual device model (17). The use of FEA avoids the sacrifice of the printed device that would occur during conventional mechanical testing. The acceptance of conventional design validation by FEA has not been expressed by the United\nStates Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) (16). At present, very little guidance exists for quality assurance of 3D printed implantable devices.\nThere are several key post-printing processes that are essential to the creation of any 3D printed medical device. Post-manufacturing processing is needed for any 3D printed stent. The method and materials used are dependent on the printing process that was utilized. Tumblers, sandblasting, or air-blasting may be needed. The International Organization of Standards (ISO) has published their standards for assessment of biocompatibility of medical devices, ISO 10993 (18). This 68-page document outlines the regulatory standards that must be followed for any device that will be directly or indirectly making contact with the body. Airway stents are considered class III devices by the USFDA (19). For class III devices, the USFDA has adopted and enforced the ISO recommendations.\nSterilization is also an important process that cannot be overlooked with 3D printing. The probability of a single unit being non-sterile after it has undergone sterilization is known as the sterility assurance level (SAL). The material used for printing, the availability of sterilization processes, and the interaction between the sterilization process and the printed material dictate the type of process used. The melting point of some printing materials (such as PCL) is below the temperature of conventional sterilization processes such as steam and ethylene oxide gas. A consensus strategy for the validation of sterility is yet to be developed. At present, the USFDA is also considering sterilization and subsequent reuse of 3D printed implantable medical devices (16). Whether such\nprocesses will be approved is yet to be determined; their applicability to PS3DS will likely be limited due to the patient-specific nature of the stent design.", "category": "other", "level": null, "page_start": null, "page_end": null, "section_id": null}, {"title": "3D printing process", "content": "Presently, the majority of 3D printing within medicine is for creating surgical guides and surgical planning (20). The application of 3D printing for custom implants (including airway stents) is still in its infancy. 3D printers have undergone significant enhancements in the current century. Unfortunately, there has been a delay in implementing this technology in pulmonary medicine; specifically, in the realm of PS3DS. A major barrier that contributed to this delay was the inability of the end-user (i.e., an interventional pulmonologist) to easily create a platform for the design and manufacturing of a PS3DS. Another bottleneck has been finding the optimal printing material that allows for easy deployment within the airway and counteracts luminal pressure to maintain airway patency.\nThe current technology used in 3D printing are the stereolithography, selective laser sintering (SLS), MultiJet modeling, and fused deposition modeling. The procedural details and materials needed vary from method to method. The US Food and Drug Administration approved multiple materials for medical 3D printing: polycaprolactone (PCL),\npolylactic acid (PLA), and poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA). These materials can be used alone or combined together to manufacture the final product. The mechanical characteristics of the printed device depend on the mixture ratio of PLA and PLGA. In addition to biocompatibility, both materials are biodegradable (21).\nDuring the initial steps, CT subtraction imaging is used to create the platform for the prototype that will be used in the 3D printer. The CT chest imaging is used to create a 3D virtual model by calculating a centerline for the patient airway. Using this as a platform, the interventional pulmonologist is able to form a PS3DS ( Figure 7 ).\nThe build of the 3D prototype starts by subtracting the data from the CT chest images and generating an image structure segmentation as digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM). The DICOM file is then converted to a standard tessellation language (STL) file generated by a computer-aided design program. The STL file can be used by the 3D printer to design the stent into several layers that range between 0.005 to 0.013 mm in thickness.\nThe costs of PS3DS can also vary widely. Overhead costs include the printer itself and the materials used for development of the prosthesis. Overall, the price per stent is difficult to estimate due to the wide variance of the costs for the process as a whole: printer, printing material,\nimaging, practice prints, designing software, computer, and dedicated time.

If plotted on the same time scale, the use of PS3DS in complex major airway disease is still in its infancy. Clinical trials do not exist, and long-term outcome data is years away. The current data regarding PS3DS is limited to a small number of case reports.\nThe first published use of an airway PS3DS was in France. A PS3DS was used successfully in a patient with a complete stenosis of their bronchus intermedius with partial dehiscence of the bronchial anastomosis in their lung allograft (22). The patient in the study reported an immediate improvement in symptoms, there were no reported complications. Gildea and colleagues were the first to use a PS3DS in a human being. They later published their one-year experience with PS3DS in two patients with airway disease due to granulomatosis with polyangiitis (23); the report was the first of its kind in the United States. Both stents were removed after one year in order to deviation\nfrom standard of care with silicone stones and to comply with the obtained USFDA compassionate use exemption. Most recently, two silicone Y PS3DS were developed and implanted via a collaboration between physicians in Austria and the United States (24). Although not technically an airway stent, a 3D printed airway splint has been created and used in severe tracheobronchomalacia of infancy (25). Overall, there is a large gap in medical literature pertaining to PS3DS. There is no published outcome comparison data between PS3DS and standard airway stents (26).", "category": "other", "level": null, "page_start": null, "page_end": null, "section_id": null}, {"title": "Future directions", "content": "With biomedical engineering evolving at a rapid rate, we anticipate the use of PS3DS to become more widespread. Technological advancement will make printing more widely available, faster, and cheaper. Patient-specific short tracheal cannulas can be developed from data from derived purely from imaging (27). We anticipate that with continued improvement with imaging and printing, PS3DS will be able to be printed to match the patient's airway with extreme precision. Work is being undertaken to better optimize the stent-airway interaction with PS3DS. The ability to predict and test forces of the adjacent airway on the stent itself would be a major advancement in the field. A group from Spain has proposed a system of computer-based mathematical optimization of a stent. Unfortunately, it is not sustainable due to the high demand on processing power and expertise. Mitigation of infection risk with PS3DS is another arena of research. A variety of methods have been proposed, but their feasibility and ability to gain approval by regulatory bodies remains in question: bactericidal agent incorporation into the printing material or stent coating, combination of hot fused filament techniques or injection mold technique with a wet printing or electrospinning, and incorporation of antibiotics into polymers (28).\nTo add another facet of complexity, the development of drug eluting stents is possible and has some potential advantages: reduction of granulation tissue formation and inhibition of tumor ingrowth. At this juncture, manufacturing is technically feasible, but it would be fraught with regulatory challenges. Once a drug is embedded, any stent is seen as a pharmaceutical product and not an implantable medical device (29). This would open the stent to the rigorous and more robust regulatory procedures faced by pharmaceutical products, and not simply a medical device.\nAirway stents are rarely implanted with the intention\nof being permanent. Biodegradable stents are currently available for use in the cardiovascular system (30). In the future, it is possible that similar technology may cross over into pulmonary medicine. Freitag and colleagues are developing and testing biodegradable airway stents in animal models (28). For optimal effect, the degradation time constants of these stents have to be well-studied as erratic and unpredictable dissolution can have adverse impacts on the airway. The consideration of their use is several years away.\nIn summary, PS3DS within the tracheobronchial tree are not yet ready for prime time. They are only being considered in the cases of compassionate use and are pending prospective studies. Further research is needed to assess their efficacy, safety, and practical feasibility. Their biggest advantage is the ability to be tailored specifically to a lesion in a patient's airway.

Silicone stents were deployed via rigid bronchoscopy and came in different shapes (bronchial, tracheal, tracheobronchial Y, and hourglass) and sizes. This followed with the adaptation of self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) from the gastroenterology and their subsequent use within the tracheobronchial tree. Over the past few years, stent technology has rapidly matured. Advancements in biomedical engineering have given rise\nto patient-specific 3D printed stents (PS3DS). Although new stents are regularly introduced to the existing market, a 'universally accepted' stent has yet to be developed (2). Like fingerprints, no two tracheobronchial diseases manifest alike, and the airway has dynamic motion with inspiration, expiration, and cough. Due to these intricacies, mass manufactured stents may not be the ideal solution for all patients or even groups of patients. Precision medicine focuses on optimizing efficiency or therapeutic benefit for a particular group of patients; it is being heavily researched in the disciplines of cardiology and oncology (3,4). Patient-\n\n## irway anatomy\n\nA tracheobronchial tree is unique for each person. It varies based on the age, gender, and height of an individual. Normal tracheal diameter ranges from 16-20 millimeters (mm) and the length 10-14 centimeters (cm). The trachea has a unique 'D' shape on a cross-section with a flat membranous posterior wall and a cartilaginous anterior arch. The right main bronchus length is shorter than the left main bronchus (1.5 vs. 4.5 cm). This is due to the more proximal take off the right upper lobe in comparison to the left upper lobe. Both main bronchi range between 8-12 mm in diameter. As no two tracheobronchial trees are exactly alike, it is challenging to find a perfectly matching tracheobronchial stent when disease can alter all the dimensions differently.\nPatient-specific 3D printed airway stents are typically considered in complex airway disorders, which are a heterogeneous group of pathologies. Airway narrowing or obstruction can produce a variety of respiratory symptoms\nthat can range from mild respiratory distress to profound respiratory failure and death.\nThe compromise of airways can be due to benign or malignant processes. Examples of benign pathology include subglottic stenosis (post-intubation or due to inflammatory disorders such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis or sarcoidosis), tracheal or bronchial stenosis, tracheobronchomalacia, excessive dynamic airway collapse, non-malignant fistulas (tracheoesophageal, bronchoesophageal, or bronchopleural), or anastomotic complications amongst lung transplantation recipients (5).\nMalignancy related airway obstruction can occur in primary lung cancer as well as metastatic disease (breast cancer, colon cancer, sarcoma, melanoma, renal cell cancer, etc.). Malignant airway obstruction can arise due to extrinsic compression, endobronchial obstruction, or a combination of both processes (6).\n\n## urrent airway stenting practice patterns\n\nManagement of diseases compromising the tracheobronchial tree is highly viable and predicated on several factors: local practice pattern, equipment availability, operator preference and experience, etc. Often, treatment mandates frequent airway evaluation with bronchoscopy and interventions to recapture the airway such as sequential balloon dilation, mechanical debulking, non-mechanical debulking with a variety of tools (thermal, laser, or cryotherapy-based ablation modalities), and stent placement for airway stabilization. The stent plays the role of airway maintenance to enable proper ventilation of the lung parenchyma beyond the stricture in malignant airway disease and to enable proper healing with minimization of the narrowed area of the airway in a benign airway disease. Stent matching of the malformed anatomy is critical to minimize the friction effect between the stent and the mucosa. Undue friction can to granulation tissue formation, and subsequent restenosis. Interventional pulmonologists have been facing complex airway disease and implanting various tracheobronchial stents for decades. In current practice, silicone and SEMS are the two main groups of airway prostheses. Both can achieve airway patency and maintain ventilation of the lung parenchyma for a time. Without a precise fit into the area, complications can arise with either type of stent: plugging with or without concurrent infection ( Figure 1 ), metal fatigue leading to fracture ( Figure 2 ), migration ( Figure 3 ), formation of granulation tissue ( Figure 4 ), and mucosal incorporation with possible erosion and perforation ( Figure 5 ) (7).\nSilicone stents and SEMS have individual advantages and disadvantages ( Table 1 ). There are a number of biophysical interactions that can have an adverse effect on the stentairway interface. Self-expanding metallic stents are not static in size. Their lengths can change under compression through a phenomenon known as foreshortening. Coughing can cause mucosal trauma from the movement of wire edges which eventually can lead to granulation tissue formation (8).\nSuboptimal pressure distribution can also cause damage to airway mucosa by impeding microcirculation and fibroblast proliferation (9). In some cases, the unequal pressure can lead to mucosal erosion and associated airway perforation.\nScar tissue and tumor respond differently to the expandable pressure generated by dilation of a stent. A stenosis may reopen easily with an expansile force but may not be able to resist compression due to adjacent tumor growth, this phenomenon is seen usually when balloon bronchoplasty is applied at the narrowed airway. Following dilation of the airway, there is a tendency to re-collapse due to external pressure from an extraluminal mass. This balance of viscoelastic factors is a complex, but an important interaction between the stent and the airway.\nThe silicone stent is cheaper when compared SEMS. Typically, they come in straight and Y varieties. The Y silicone stent is more predisposed to mucus build up, which can lead to plugging and infection. Straight silicone stents are more likely migrate when compared to their metallic counterparts (10). Due to its configuration, the Y silicone stent tends to migrate less when compared to their straight counterparts. For proper maintenance, silicone stents typically require, medication to help with mucus clearance, frequent surveillance bronchoscopies with stent revision (11,12).\nDue to the materials used for production and the manufacturing process, SEMS are more expensive. When deployed, these stents expand within the airway. The expansive force must be optimized to reduce the risk of complications. T oo much expansive radial force can cause tissue injury due to mucosal ischemia, while too little (or too much) can lead to stent migration (13). Metal fatigue and stent metal fragmentation are not uncommon phenomena (7,12). Stent deployment must be performed with care as the SEMS can follow the path of least resistance (nonstenotic airway segment) rather than staying engaged in the stenotic area ( Figure 3 ).\nAlthough the SEMS that are currently available on the market comes in a variety of sizes, the problem of size mismatching between tracheobronchial is still encountered by many interventional pulmonologists (2). One of the options is to customize manufactured silicone stents to accommodate with the airway anatomy. These adjustments include cutting the silicone stent to fit the airway narrowing and avoid coverage of the main lobar outlets, using intussusception technique to extend the stent length to cover a larger area of stenosis (14), and suturing two different types of silicone stents together (Y stent and\n\nbronchial straight stent) to better approximate the size and length of the main bronchus ( Figure 6 ). While these techniques are somewhat effective, they fail to achieve the desired degree of precision for stent-airway size matching.\n\n## airway stent printing\n\nIn response to the limitations of commercially available stents, alternative methods of airway stent manufacturing such as custom 3D stent printing are being considered. The pioneers of 3D printing include Dr. Kodama, Charles Hull, and Charles Deckard. The application of 3D printing in medicine is not a novel concept. The medical industry accounts for over a quarter of the applications of 3D printing amongst various fields (15). Initially used for prototyping, 3D printing is now used to manufacture prosthesis, instruments, implants, and artificial organs for research purposes. With the right equipment and expertise, 3D printing can allow point-of-care fabrication of customized implants, including airway stents.\nIt must be kept in mind that the variability of build processes and high degree of customizability pose challenges to meeting regulatory standards and quality assurance (16). Conventional design validation for custom 3D printed airway stents is both labor and cost intensive. As an alternative, finite element analysis (FEA) can be used to predict the mechanical performance of a virtual device model (17). The use of FEA avoids the sacrifice of the printed device that would occur during conventional mechanical testing. The acceptance of conventional design validation by FEA has not been expressed by the United\nStates Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) (16). At present, very little guidance exists for quality assurance of 3D printed implantable devices.\nThere are several key post-printing processes that are essential to the creation of any 3D printed medical device. Post-manufacturing processing is needed for any 3D printed stent. The method and materials used are dependent on the printing process that was utilized. Tumblers, sandblasting, or air-blasting may be needed. The International Organization of Standards (ISO) has published their standards for assessment of biocompatibility of medical devices, ISO 10993 (18). This 68-page document outlines the regulatory standards that must be followed for any device that will be directly or indirectly making contact with the body. Airway stents are considered class III devices by the USFDA (19). For class III devices, the USFDA has adopted and enforced the ISO recommendations.\nSterilization is also an important process that cannot be overlooked with 3D printing. The probability of a single unit being non-sterile after it has undergone sterilization is known as the sterility assurance level (SAL). The material used for printing, the availability of sterilization processes, and the interaction between the sterilization process and the printed material dictate the type of process used. The melting point of some printing materials (such as PCL) is below the temperature of conventional sterilization processes such as steam and ethylene oxide gas. A consensus strategy for the validation of sterility is yet to be developed. At present, the USFDA is also considering sterilization and subsequent reuse of 3D printed implantable medical devices (16). Whether such\nprocesses will be approved is yet to be determined; their applicability to PS3DS will likely be limited due to the patient-specific nature of the stent design.\n\n## printing process\n\nPresently, the majority of 3D printing within medicine is for creating surgical guides and surgical planning (20). The application of 3D printing for custom implants (including airway stents) is still in its infancy. 3D printers have undergone significant enhancements in the current century. Unfortunately, there has been a delay in implementing this technology in pulmonary medicine; specifically, in the realm of PS3DS. A major barrier that contributed to this delay was the inability of the end-user (i.e., an interventional pulmonologist) to easily create a platform for the design and manufacturing of a PS3DS. Another bottleneck has been finding the optimal printing material that allows for easy deployment within the airway and counteracts luminal pressure to maintain airway patency.\nThe current technology used in 3D printing are the stereolithography, selective laser sintering (SLS), MultiJet modeling, and fused deposition modeling. The procedural details and materials needed vary from method to method. The US Food and Drug Administration approved multiple materials for medical 3D printing: polycaprolactone (PCL),\npolylactic acid (PLA), and poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA). These materials can be used alone or combined together to manufacture the final product. The mechanical characteristics of the printed device depend on the mixture ratio of PLA and PLGA. In addition to biocompatibility, both materials are biodegradable (21).\nDuring the initial steps, CT subtraction imaging is used to create the platform for the prototype that will be used in the 3D printer. The CT chest imaging is used to create a 3D virtual model by calculating a centerline for the patient airway. Using this as a platform, the interventional pulmonologist is able to form a PS3DS ( Figure 7 ).\nThe build of the 3D prototype starts by subtracting the data from the CT chest images and generating an image structure segmentation as digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM). The DICOM file is then converted to a standard tessellation language (STL) file generated by a computer-aided design program. The STL file can be used by the 3D printer to design the stent into several layers that range between 0.005 to 0.013 mm in thickness.\nThe costs of PS3DS can also vary widely. Overhead costs include the printer itself and the materials used for development of the prosthesis. Overall, the price per stent is difficult to estimate due to the wide variance of the costs for the process as a whole: printer, printing material,\nimaging, practice prints, designing software, computer, and dedicated time. It is yet to be determined if PS3DS is a cost-effective option.\n\n## printing landscape in present day\n\nWhen compared to other subspecialties, interventional pulmonology in its adolescence. If plotted on the same time scale, the use of PS3DS in complex major airway disease is still in its infancy. Clinical trials do not exist, and long-term outcome data is years away. The current data regarding PS3DS is limited to a small number of case reports.\nThe first published use of an airway PS3DS was in France. A PS3DS was used successfully in a patient with a complete stenosis of their bronchus intermedius with partial dehiscence of the bronchial anastomosis in their lung allograft (22). The patient in the study reported an immediate improvement in symptoms, there were no reported complications. Gildea and colleagues were the first to use a PS3DS in a human being. They later published their one-year experience with PS3DS in two patients with airway disease due to granulomatosis with polyangiitis (23); the report was the first of its kind in the United States. Both stents were removed after one year in order to deviation\nfrom standard of care with silicone stones and to comply with the obtained USFDA compassionate use exemption. Most recently, two silicone Y PS3DS were developed and implanted via a collaboration between physicians in Austria and the United States (24). Although not technically an airway stent, a 3D printed airway splint has been created and used in severe tracheobronchomalacia of infancy (25). Overall, there is a large gap in medical literature pertaining to PS3DS. There is no published outcome comparison data between PS3DS and standard airway stents (26).\n\n## uture directions\n\nWith biomedical engineering evolving at a rapid rate, we anticipate the use of PS3DS to become more widespread. Technological advancement will make printing more widely available, faster, and cheaper. Patient-specific short tracheal cannulas can be developed from data from derived purely from imaging (27). We anticipate that with continued improvement with imaging and printing, PS3DS will be able to be printed to match the patient's airway with extreme precision. Work is being undertaken to better optimize the stent-airway interaction with PS3DS. The ability to predict and test forces of the adjacent airway on the stent itself would be a major advancement in the field. A group from Spain has proposed a system of computer-based mathematical optimization of a stent. Unfortunately, it is not sustainable due to the high demand on processing power and expertise. Mitigation of infection risk with PS3DS is another arena of research. A variety of methods have been proposed, but their feasibility and ability to gain approval by regulatory bodies remains in question: bactericidal agent incorporation into the printing material or stent coating, combination of hot fused filament techniques or injection mold technique with a wet printing or electrospinning, and incorporation of antibiotics into polymers (28).\nTo add another facet of complexity, the development of drug eluting stents is possible and has some potential advantages: reduction of granulation tissue formation and inhibition of tumor ingrowth. At this juncture, manufacturing is technically feasible, but it would be fraught with regulatory challenges. Once a drug is embedded, any stent is seen as a pharmaceutical product and not an implantable medical device (29). This would open the stent to the rigorous and more robust regulatory procedures faced by pharmaceutical products, and not simply a medical device.\nAirway stents are rarely implanted with the intention\nof being permanent. Biodegradable stents are currently available for use in the cardiovascular system (30). In the future, it is possible that similar technology may cross over into pulmonary medicine. Freitag and colleagues are developing and testing biodegradable airway stents in animal models (28). For optimal effect, the degradation time constants of these stents have to be well-studied as erratic and unpredictable dissolution can have adverse impacts on the airway. The consideration of their use is several years away.\nIn summary, PS3DS within the tracheobronchial tree are not yet ready for prime time. They are only being considered in the cases of compassionate use and are pending prospective studies. Further research is needed to assess their efficacy, safety, and practical feasibility. Their biggest advantage is the ability to be tailored specifically to a lesion in a patient's airway. Although the early clinical experience is promising and the employed technology is exciting, the clinical value proposition is yet to be discerned in comparative clinical trials.\n\n## cknowledgements\n\nFunding : NIH-NCAI grant support (grant 1U54HL119810-03).\n\n## ootnote\n\nConflicts of Interest: Cleveland Clinic and Cleveland Clinic Institutional Officials/Leaders have an equity interest in Custom Orthopaedic Solutions and are entitled to royalty payments from the company for technology developed at Cleveland Clinic.

Patients with advanced emphysema, one of the diseases that comprises Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are characterized by hyperin fl ation that precipitates breathlessness and predisposes\nindividuals to exacerbations and has a greater negative impact on health status than self-reported cardiovascular disease and diabetes (2, 3).\nMany surgical procedures have been devised to treat this disease including costochondrectomy, phrenic crush, pneumoperitoneum, pleural abrasion, surgical lung denervation, and thoracoplasty. But apart from lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), bullectomy, and lung transplantation all others have not proven to be viable (4). LVRS has been extensively studied, and in appropriately selected patients reduces hyperin fl ation improving lung function, dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and long-term survival (5 -7). However, LVRS is underused because of concerns about the invasiveness of the procedure, increased associated perioperative morbidity and mortality, and narrow patient eligibility criteria (8 -10). Zephyr Endobronchial Valves (Zephyr EBV, Pulmonx Corporation) are small duckbill valves inserted bronchoscopically into the lung to occlude an emphysematous lobe. Lobar de fl ation from the EBV leads to partial or full lobar atelectasis, thus reducing hyperin fl ation and mimicking the mechanisms of LVRS.\nIn the fi rst randomized controlled trial of Zephyr EBV, VENT (Endobronchial Valve for Emphysema Palliation Trial), the coprimary endpoints of FEV1 and 6-minute-walk distance (6MWD) achieved statistical but not clinically meaningful improvements between groups (11). Post hoc analysis showed that only patients with complete fi ssures in the treated lung and in whom lobar occlusion (occlusive positioning of valves in all segmental and subsegmental airways feeding the\ntarget lobe) was achieved had clinically meaningful outcomes (12, 13).\nAfter VENT, subsequent short-term studies with Zephyr EBV have shown that by selecting patients with little to no collateral ventilation between target and ipsilateral lobes and performing post-procedure con fi rmation of lobar occlusion, similar bene fi ts to LVRS can be achieved in patients with heterogeneous or homogeneous emphysema (14 -17) but with less morbidity. All these studies included a control arm and followed subjects out to 3 or 6 months.\nLIBERATE (Pulmonx Endobronchial Valves Used in Treatment of Emphysema) is the fi rst large randomized controlled multicenter international study conducted in patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema and with little to no collateral ventilation in the target lung to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and durability of bene fi t out to 12 months. The study compared Zephyr EBV treatment with standard medical management to standard medical management alone.\nSome of the results have been previously reported in the form of an abstract (18).\n\n## ethods\n\nThis trial (NCT01796392) conducted under a U.S. Food and Drug Administration -approved Investigational Device Exemption for the Zephyr EBV enrolled patients between October 2013 and September 2016 at 24 sites (18 sites in the United States and 6 sites outside the United States).

Based on the results of these studies, the responder rate (FEV1 improvement of > 15%) in the Zephyr EBV treatment group was expected to be approximately 35% at 1 year. The responder rate for the control group was not expected to exceed 10% at 1 year. Assuming a two-sided 0.05 a level, study power of 90%, and 2:1 allocation random assignment, a sample size of 147 was expected to be adequate to test for superiority. The study sample size was increased to 183 to allow for 20% lost to follow-up and incomplete data. Each study site was allowed to enroll a maximum of 25 study participants.\nEligible emphysema patients were exsmokers between 40 and 75 years of age, with post-bronchodilator (BD) FEV1 between 15% and 45% predicted, TLC greater than 100% predicted, residual volume (RV) greater than or equal to 175% predicted, DL CO greater than or equal to 20% predicted, and a 6MWD between 100 and 500 m after a supervised pulmonary rehabilitation program (complete inclusion and exclusion criteria provided in Section E1 in the online supplement). Target lobe selection was based on a greater than 50% destruction score (percentage of voxels less than 2 910 Houns fi eld units on computed tomography [CT]) and heterogeneous emphysema de fi ned as absolute difference of 15 or greater in destruction scores between the targeted and ipsilateral lobes determined by investigational sites using Myrian quantitative software (Intrasense; see Figure E1).\nEligible patients were assessed with the Chartis to determine collateral ventilation status between targeted and adjacent lobes before randomization (19) (additional details provided in Section E2). Figure E2 shows examples of ' collateral ventilation negative ' and ' collateral ventilation positive ' assessments on Chartis. Subjects deemed to have a ' collateral ventilation negative ' target lobe by Chartis were randomized in a 2:1 fashion (blocked\ndesign) immediately after the Chartis assessment to either the EBV or standardof-care (SoC) groups ( see Section E3). The bronchoscopy procedure for subjects randomized to SoC was terminated after the Chartis assessment and subjects recovered per institutional clinical practice. Subjects randomized to EBV underwent placement of Zephyr EBV valves during the same session with the intent to achieve complete lobar occlusion (20). Subjects assessed as ' collateral ventilation positive ' were exited from the study ( see Section E2 for complete details).\nSubjects randomized to SoC were discharged after post-bronchoscopy recovery. Subjects randomized to EBV were hospitalized for 5 nights regardless of clinical status and underwent daily chest radiographs (with the fi rst taken within an hour of the bronchoscopy procedure) until discharge ( see Figure E3 for postrandomization follow-up of study subjects). Frequency of chest radiographs for any hospitalization for an adverse event was at the discretion of the physician, but a chest radiograph was required on the day of discharge. Clinical staff was trained regarding the risk of a pneumothorax; equipment needed to treat a pneumothorax was kept bedside. At discharge, subjects were provided a wrist-band denoting ' patient at risk of pneumothorax ' and were instructed to seek immediate medical attention in the event of symptoms of a potential pneumothorax.\nEBV subjects were contacted daily by telephone for 10 days after discharge; and evaluated during site visits at Day 7, Day 30, and Day 45 after discharge. At 45 days, a high-resolution CT scan was performed and assessed by an Independent Core Lab (MedQIA) to determine target lobe volume reduction (TLVR), and to verify whether complete lobar occlusion had been achieved. If necessary (TLVR , 50%, and incomplete lobar occlusion), a repeat bronchoscopy and valve revision/replacement was recommended. All subjects had clinical visits at 45 days and 3, 6 , 9, and 12 months after bronchoscopy. To reduce variability in the collection of the spirometry data, all study sites used the ERT MasterScope (eResearch Technology), a central diagnostic station attached to a spirometer to capture the FEV1 and FVC measurements ( see Section E4). EBV-treated subjects are planned for annual follow-up for an additional 4 years. After the 12-month\nevaluation, if eligible, SoC group subjects were given the option to crossover to EBV treatment with planned follow-up for an additional 5 years.\n\n## rimary Outcome\n\nThe primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects in the EBV group at 1 year after the procedure who had an improvement in the post-BD FEV1 of greater than or equal to 15% compared with the percentage of subjects achieving this improvement in the SoC group.\n\n## econdary Outcomes\n\nThe secondary outcomes included difference between EBV and SoC groups in the absolute change at 1 year in FEV1, St. George ' s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and 6MWD. Additional effectiveness measures included TLVR at 45 days and 1 year after the procedure, RV, inspiratory capacity, TLC, FRC, DL CO, modi fi ed Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC), BODE (body mass index, air fl ow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity) index, and for the EBV group only, the absolute and percent change in and the percentage of subjects achieving a TLVR minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of greater than Odds ratio (or) equal to 350 ml (19) relative to baseline.\nSafety was assessed in the treatment period (procedure through 45 d) and longer-term period (46 d through 1 yr) through review of all adverse events solicited at all scheduled or unscheduled visits. An independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) adjudicated serious adverse events (SAEs), device-related events, and select respiratory adverse events. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board provided study oversight to ensure patient rights and safety were respected and maintained.\n\n## tatistical Analyses\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS versions 9.3 (SAS Institute). The rationale for the sample size is provided in Section E5. Descriptive statistics included means, SD, and 95% con fi dence intervals. Continuous variables were compared with an analysis of covariance with the respective baseline value as the covariate, and categorical variables were compared with the Fisher exact test, a chi-square test, or a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Adverse event rates were compared using Poisson\nregression. An interim analysis was performed when 74 subjects had completed 12-month follow-up. To account for the interim analysis, the threshold for signi fi cance for the Z -statistic at 12 months\nwas Z greater than or equal to 2.004. The Hochberg step-up procedure was used to control for multiple secondary endpoint analyses (21). Additional details are provided in Section E6.\n\n## emographics\n\nA total of 190 subjects who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were\nDefinition of abbreviations : BMI = body mass index; BODE = BMI, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; EBV = Zephyr Endobronchial Valve; GOLD = Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease; HU = Hounsfield units; IC = inspiratory capacity; mMRC = modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale; NS = not significant; post-BD = post-bronchodilator; RV = residual volume; SGRQ = St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire; SoC = standard-of-care.\nValues are means\n6\nSD.\n*Emphysema destruction score was assessed as the percentage of voxels of less than 2 910 HU on computed tomography.\n† Heterogeneity index was assessed as the difference in the emphysema score between the target and the ipsilateral lobe.\n\n## RIGINAL ARTICLE\n\n' collateral ventilation negative ' for the target lobe according to Chartis assessment were randomized; 128 subjects (56 male/72 female) to EBV, and 62 subjects (33 male/29 female) to SoC ( see Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials diagram, Figure 1). Both groups were well matched for all baseline demographics and clinical characteristics, except for the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage classi fi cation, with more GOLD stage IV subjects in the SoC group ( P =0.037) (Table 1; see Tables E1 -E5).\n\n## rocedural Details\n\nA median of four valves (range, 2 -8) per subject were implanted in the 128 EBV subjects either under general anesthesia (64.8%) or conscious sedation (35.2%). Distribution of treated lobes was 66.4% left upper lobe, 11.7% left lower lobe, 10.9% right upper lobe, 6.3% right upper and right middle lobe combined, and 4.7% right lower lobe ( see Table E6 for procedural details). Sixteen subjects (12.5%) with incomplete lobar occlusion and TLVR less than 50% veri fi ed through the highresolution CT assessment at 45 days were eligible for valve adjustment; an additional two subjects were considered for valve adjustment by the investigator. Of these, 11 subjects underwent valve-adjustment procedures ( see Table E7). A total of 35 subjects underwent 54 secondary procedures of which 11 procedures were for the protocol-allowed adjustment after veri fi cation of lobar occlusion, 28 procedures were for valve removals and/or subsequent valve replacement after an adverse event (adverse events requiring valve removal included 12 pneumothorax, two increased dyspnea, one respiratory failure, one hypoxemia, one subcutaneous emphysema, and one valve migration), 12 procedures were for clinical investigation ( fi ve for inspection of valves because of loss of atelectasis, three for lavage to clear mucus, four to investigate blood in sputum), and the remaining three procedures were for patient-requested valve removals for perceived lack of bene fi t. Eight subjects had all valves removed before to the 12-month evaluation.\n\n## utcomes\n\nPrimary outcome. At 12 months after the procedure, 47.7% of the EBV subjects compared with 16.8% SoC subjects had a\ngreater than or equal to 15% increase over baseline in post-BD FEV1, with a betweengroup absolute difference of 31.0 (95% con fi dence interval, 18.0 -43.9%; P , 0.001; intention-to-treat). The results of the primary effectiveness endpoint are shown graphically in Figure 2.\nSecondary outcomes. All three secondary endpoints improved in favor of EBVand met statistical signi fi cance (Table 2 and Figure 3); the difference of means between EBV and SoC groups from baseline to 12 months for the absolute change in FEV1 was 0.106 L (17.96% for percent change in FEV1; P , 0.001) (Figure 3A), 6MWD was 39.3 m ( P = 0.002) (Figure 3B), and SGRQ was 2 7.05 points ( P = 0.004) (Figure 3C). Improvements in FEV1, 6MWD, and SGRQ score after EBV treatment were evident as early as 45 days after the procedure and persisted out to at least 12 months (Figure 4).\nThere were two measures at baseline that were imbalanced between the EBV and SoC groups at a two-sided 0.10 level, mMRC ( P = 0.091) and GOLD stage classi fi cation based on the percent predicted FEV1 ( P =0.037); however, there was no imbalance between groups based on FEV1. The interaction terms from logistic regression or from analysis of covariance with factors of treatment group and baseline value for mMRC or GOLD stage classi fi cation as covariate were not signi fi cant for the primary endpoint ( P = 0.799 and P = 0.906 for mMRC and GOLD, respectively), or any of the secondary endpoints. Thus, neither of these variables had an impact on the primary or secondary effectiveness endpoints. The P value for the logistic regression with factors of treatment group, investigational site, and treatment group by investigational site interaction did not show any investigational site effect ( P = 0.785).\nA signi fi cantly greater percentage of subjects in the EBV group than in the SoC group met Odds ratio (or) exceeded the MCID for FEV1 (change of > 15% and > 12%), SGRQ (change of <2 4 points), and 6MWD (change of > 25 m), indicating meaningful clinical bene fi t was achieved (Figure 5; 6-mo responder data in Figure E4). Correspondingly, a higher percentage of subjects in the SoC group consistently either declined or had no change compared with the EBV group across these endpoints (Figure 6). Individual subject responses to each of these measures are presented graphically in Figure E5.\nAt 45 days after the procedure, 79.1% of subjects achieved a TLVR of greater than or equal to 350 ml, with a mean reduction of 1.03 6 0.68 L ( P , 0.001) and at 12 months, 84.2% of subjects achieved a TLVR of greater than or equal to 350 ml, with a mean reduction of 1.14 6 0.70 L ( P , 0.001) (Figure 5).\nConsistent with a durable TLVR at 12 months in the EBV group, there was a signi fi cant reduction in hyperin fl ation as measured by RV (decrease of 522 ml; P , 0.001; EBV -SoC) and RV/TLC ratio (decrease of 0.05; P , 0.001; EBV -SoC) (Table 2). At 12 months, RV decrease of 310 ml or more was achieved by 61.6% EBV subjects compared with 22.4% subjects in the SoC group (Figure 5). There was a signi fi cant improvement in gas exchange in the EBV compared with SoC groups (increase in DL CO of 0.870 ml CO/min/mm Hg; P = 0.013; EBV -SoC). The mMRC dyspnea score improved in favor of EBV with a between-group change of 2 0.8 points ( P , 0.001) with a greater number of subjects in the EBV group (47.8%) than in the SOC group (18.6%) meeting Odds ratio (or) exceeding the MCID of 2 1 point change; P , 0.001).\nSubjects in the EBV group had a greater reduction from baseline in the\nmulticomponent composite BODE index than those in the SoC group, with a mean difference between groups of 2 1.2 points ( P , 0.001) at 12 months. More subjects in the EBV than in the SoC group were responders achieving a MCID change of 2 1 point Odds ratio (or) less (58.0% vs. 24.1%, respectively; P , 0.001) (Figure 6). Supplemental oxygen usage at 12 months in the EBV and SoC group subjects was evaluated to compare change in oxygen usage from baseline. A larger proportion of EBV subjects than SoC subjects (15.7% vs. 6.9%, respectively) used less oxygen, whereas a larger proportion of SoC subjects\nthan EBV subjects (22.4% vs. 11.3%, respectively) used more oxygen, at 12 months than their baseline usage; the distribution of oxygen change categories was statistically signi fi cant ( P = 0.019) when comparing EBV with SoC ( see Table E8).\n\n## ubjects with no valves at 12-month\n\nevaluation. Eight subjects who had all valves removed before their 12-month evaluation ( fi ve for a pneumothorax, two for increased dyspnea, and one for pneumonia) did not\nachieve any bene fi t when compared with EBV subjects with valves ( see Table E9). Outcomes for subjects with no valves at 12 months were not dissimilar from the SoC group (Table 2).\nType of anesthesia used. The percent of subjects achieving an FEV1 improvement of greater than or equal to 15% based on the type of anesthesia used for the EBV procedure were similar with 49.2% in the conscious sedation group and 46.9% in the general anesthesia group. Adverse events occurring at a frequency of 3% or greater for the subgroups of anesthesia type are provided in Table E10.\nDefinition of abbreviations : 6MWD=6-minute-walk distance; BODE = body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity; CI = confidence interval; EBV = Zephyr Endobronchial Valve; IC = inspiratory capacity; mMRC = modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale; NA = not applicable; post-BD = post-bronchodilator; RV = residual volume; SGRQ = St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire; SoC = standard-of-care; TLVR = target lobe volume reduction.\n\n## pper versus lower lobe treatments.\n\nSimilar bene fi ts were seen in the upper lobe and lower lobe subgroups with 45.9% upper lobe treated subjects and 57.1% lower lobe treated subjects with an FEV1 improvement of greater than or equal to 15%. The secondary endpoint results for these subgroups are provided in Table E11.\n\n## dverse Events\n\nA summary of all adverse events occurring at a frequency of 3% or more is provided in Table E12. Of the 501 EBVs that were implanted, two EBVs (in two subjects) were expectorated and three EBVs (in three subjects) migrated throughout the 12month follow-up for a 0.4% expectoration rate and 0.6% migration rate. Investigatorreported respiratory SAEs listed in Table 3 show that signi fi cantly more subjects in the EBV group (35.2%) than in the SoC group (4.8%) experienced respiratory SAEs in the treatment period (day of procedure/randomization to 45 d) immediately after the bronchoscopy procedure ( P , 0.001). This difference was primarily caused by a higher frequency of pneumothoraces in the EBV group during the treatment period, which were managed according to previously published and protocolized pneumothorax management algorithm (22) ( see Figure E6). Select respiratory SAEs with onset after the most\nrecent bronchoscopy procedure are summarized in Table E13.\nHowever, during the longer-term period ( . 46 d until 12-mo visit), the frequency of events was comparable between groups with 33.6% of the EBV group subjects and 30.6% of the SoC group subjects experiencing one or more respiratory SAEs. During the longerterm period (Table 3), there was a lower frequency of SAEs (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, pneumonias, and respiratory failure) in the EBV group than in the SoC group (23.0% vs. 30.6%, 5.7% vs. 8.1%, and 0.8% vs. 3.2%, respectively), although none of these differences reached statistical signi fi cance. Over the 12-month follow-up, there were no episodes of hemoptysis (de fi ned as . 200 ml blood loss in , 24 h).\nTable 4 shows the rates of respiratory SAEs (i.e., annualized rates based on the time of occurrence). Investigator-reported event rates are compared with the CEC adjudicated event rates; CEC adjudication removed any investigator bias on nomenclature and attribution of adverse events by using standardized de fi nitions. Based on the CEC adjudication, during the treatment period, only the pneumothorax rate was signi fi cantly different between groups with 0.275 events/45 days in the EBV group compared with no events in the SoC group ( P , 0.001). During the longer-term period, CEC-adjudicated\npneumothorax rates continued to be signi fi cantly different between groups with 0.074 events/yr compared with no events in the SoC group ( P = 0.013). However, during the longer-term period, serious Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations and respiratory failure events rates trended to be lower in the EBV group than in the SoC group with 0.352 events/yr compared with 0.573 events/yr ( P = 0.053) and 0.019 events/yr compared with 0.099 events/yr ( P = 0.033), respectively.\n\n## neumothorax\n\nThe major post-procedural complication was pneumothorax with 46 pneumothorax events occurring in 44 EBV subjects (34.4%) during the 12-month period. Eight of these events did not require any intervention (observation only). A total of 38 of the 46 pneumothoraces (83%) were managed with a placement of a chest tube; 12 of these events also required the removal of at least one valve. None of the pneumothoraces occurring in the longerterm period required the removal of any valves for their management. A total of 43 of the 46 pneumothoraces occurred within 13 days of a recent bronchoscopy procedure, of which 35 (76%) occurred within the fi rst 3 days as shown in Figure 7, for a median event onset time of 1.0 day from a recent bronchoscopy procedure.\nSubjects with pneumothorax ( n =44) experienced similar bene fi ts at 12 months to subjects without a pneumothorax ( n =84);\n( see Table E14). Exploratory analyses of subjects who experienced either a ' complex ' pneumothorax (de fi ned by either death or removal of all EBVs) or a ' simple ' pneumothorax (all other pneumothoraces) showed that subjects were at higher risk of a ' complex ' pneumothorax if the lobe with maximum destruction score is not treated, and the nontreated contralateral lung destruction score is greater than 60%. Qualitative assessment of CTs of the EBV group by an independent thoracic radiologist (Imaging Core Lab) of radiologic features that included presence or absence of pleural adhesions, intraparenchymal scars, blebs, bullae, and paraseptal cysts in target and\nnontarget lobes did not identify any variable that was statistically signi fi cant in predicting the occurrence of a pneumothorax.\n\n## ortality\n\nDuring the treatment period, there were four deaths in the EBV group (3.1% of subjects; three from a pneumothorax on Day 3, Day 3, and Day 13, and one from respiratory failure on Day 11) compared with none in the SoC group. The three pneumothorax-related deaths occurred in subjects who were not treated in the most diseased lobe. Of the four deaths in the EBV group, three were considered ' de fi nitely related ' and one ' probably related ' to the\nEBV treatment. During the longer-term period, there was one death (0.8%) in the EBV group on Day 147 resulting from a Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation that was not related to the device, and one cardiac arrhythmia related in the SoC group (1.6%) on Day 141.\n\n## iscussion\n\nBronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) with Zephyr EBV is a breakthrough approach for reducing hyperin fl ation in patients with severe emphysema. This multicenter randomized controlled trial demonstrates that Zephyr EBV treatment in\nB\nC\nD\nSix-Minute Walk Distance (meters)\npatients with severe emphysema selected for little to no collateral ventilation between the treated and the ipsilateral lobe resulted in signi fi cant lobar volume reduction, with consequent reduction in hyperin fl ation, and clinically meaningful improvements in dyspnea, lung function, exercise-capacity, and quality of life. Similar results have been reported previously (14 -17).\nExcept for a higher proportion of categorically de fi ned GOLD stage IV\nsubjects in the SoC group, the EBV and SoC groups were well matched for baseline demographics and clinical characteristics; including mean post-BD FEV1. However, this difference did not impact either the primary or secondary effectiveness outcomes based on analysis of covariance with baseline GOLD stage as a covariate.\nThe study met its primary endpoint with 47.7% EBV subjects compared with 16.8% SoC subjects achieving an\nimprovement in FEV1 of greater than Odds ratio (or) equal to 15% ( P , 0.001). Although the MCID cut off for change in FEV1 is highly variable, ranging from 10% to 15% (23), this threshold of 15% for the responder analysis was based on discussion with the Food and Drug Administration as the a priori threshold that they required for the pivotal U.S. trial. The absolute difference in means for FEV1 of 0.106 L signi fi es a meaningful important clinical change (24).\nImportantly, 79.1% of patients in the EBV group achieved the MCID for TLVR at 45 days; and 84.2% at 12 months con fi rming proper patient selection with Chartis and successful lobar occlusion. The overall mean change in target lobe volume radiographically determined by highresolution CT at 12 months was a reduction of 1.14 L, which corresponded to a mean reduction in RV of 0.5 L (or a 10.38% decrease from baseline). TLVR and consequent reduction in RV are consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of EBV and are comparable with changes after LVRS (25).\nThe major signi fi cant side effect associated with the EBV procedure in the short-term treatment period was pneumothorax. Targeted lobar de fl ation likely causes in fl ation of the ipsilateral lobe, which can result in a tear of the already compromised parenchymal tissue of the emphysematous ipsilateral lobe, resulting in a pneumothorax. As seen in this study and reported previously (17, 26) subjects experiencing a pneumothorax attained the same level of bene fi t over the long-term as those without pneumothorax. The three\n\n## esponders at 12-Months\n\npneumothorax-related deaths that occurred in subjects that were not treated in the most diseased lobe because of the heterogeneity requirement (difference in heterogeneity score of 15 between target and ipsilateral lobes) and the absence of collateral ventilation may imply that subjects with reduced capacity in the nontreated contralateral lung experience higher risk from the insult of single-lung ventilation during the pneumothorax event. Physicians performing EBV treatment must be trained on appropriate patient and lobe selection for treatment and anticipate and recognize a pneumothorax, which can be readily managed using standard approaches (22).\nThe difference between groups for the change from baseline to 12 months of 39 m in the 6MWD is meaningful and demonstrates the persistent bene fi t EBV treatment provides in improving exercise tolerance in this patient group (27 -29). The absolute mean change in 6MWD in the EBV group at 12 months compared with baseline was only 13 m. However, left untreated, the decline in 6MWD in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at GOLD stage III/IV would be expected to be signi fi cant over time (30). As an example, in the NETT (National Emphysema Treatment Trial) study, untreated control patients in the non -highrisk group showed declines of 40 m in the\n6MWD at 1 year (5). In this study, the 6MWD in the SoC group declined by 26.3 m from baseline to 12 months. Although there was a wide range of baseline 6MWD, there was no correlation between baseline 6MWD and key outcomes of FEV1, 6MWD, or SGRQ in contrast to NETT where substantial bene fi t was seen only in patients with low exercise tolerance (31). Although not powered to demonstrate this change, there was a reduction in the rate of respiratory failure events ( P = 0.033) and a trend for a reduction in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations resulting in hospitalizations ( P = 0.053) and in the longer-term period between EBV and SoC. These\nDefinition of abbreviations : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)=chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; EBV = Zephyr Endobronchial Valve; SoC = standard of care.

An additional important outcome in LIBERATE is the strong signal for the potential to reduce respiratory failure and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations requiring hospitalization in the longer term, both being important goals of therapy for these patients. Taken together with the previous demonstration of its effectiveness in patients with both heterogeneous (14, 15, 17) and homogeneous (15, 16) emphysema selected for little to no collateral ventilation, unilateral EBV treatment now provides a\nviable treatment option for a group of patients with emphysema that is currently lacking. Unlike surgery or other bronchoscopic interventions (33 -36) EBVs are readily removable, allowing the procedure to be reversed if a patient does not respond or has complications.\nThe 27% frequency of pneumothorax SAEs in the treatment period is consistent with previous studies (16, 17) and the occurrence of pneumothorax does not seem to negatively impact clinical outcomes as seen in this study and previously reported by Gompelmann and coworkers (26) and Kemp and coworkers (17). Seventy-six percent of the pneumothoraces occurred within 3 days after the most recent bronchoscopy (index procedure for those who did not have a secondary bronchoscopy), and 85% were within 5 days after the most recent bronchoscopy procedure. These statistics support a minimum 3-day hospital stay after EBV procedure to ensure timely management of a pneumothorax if it occurs. As in previous studies, the speci fi c algorithm for managing pneumothorax after EBV procedures developed by experts (22) was used to manage this consequence of the procedure during the present study and highlights the need for physicians performing\nthis procedure to have expertise in the management of procedural complications. One pneumothorax-related death at 13 days post-EBV procedure underlines the need to provide patients with clear instructions on recognizing symptoms of a pneumothorax and to seek emergent help if experiencing these symptoms.\nThe study has certain limitations. First, although many subjects did not meet the very strict inclusion/exclusion criteria that included baseline lung function measures, prior medical history, and so forth, 40% (280/706) of the screen failures were related to destruction score and heterogeneity requirements, the thresholds for which were arbitrarily chosen at the time the study was designed. Subsequent experience with homogenous patients in other trials (15, 16) has established the applicability of this therapy to a broader population. Similarly, the inclusion of subjects with little or no collateral ventilation was limited to their assessment with Chartis, which uses physiologic measures of air fl ow and airway resistance for assessing collateral ventilation status. The more recent evolution of novel quantitative CT (QCT) techniques now enables the noninvasive screening of subjects for collateral ventilation, with immediate exclusion of subjects with less than 80% complete fi ssure on QCT, Chartis requirement only in subjects with greater than 80% to less than 95% complete fi ssure on QCT, and treatment with EBV of subjects with greater than 95% complete fi ssure on QCT without Chartis (37, 38). This approach could have streamlined the screening out of subjects with completely absent fi ssures and perhaps reduced some screening bronchoscopies in this study.\nA second limitation of the study was allowing a repeat bronchoscopy for valve revision/replacement only in subjects with TLVR less than 50%, and incomplete lobar occlusion based on the 45-day CT assessment by the Imaging Core Lab. These dual criteria were too restrictive and prevented many subjects from potentially bene fi tting from a revision procedure. In clinical practice (20), repeat bronchoscopies for valve revision are performed based on clinical judgment if a patient has a lack of clinical response or experiences a sudden late loss of bene fi t.\nThe observed bene fi t to risk pro fi le of EBVtreatment must be assessed considering the limited treatment options for patients\nwith severe emphysema. LIBERATE shows improvements over nontreated control subjects at the same magnitude as those seen after LVRS (EBV vs. LVRS: FEV1 [29], 17% vs. 19%; 6MWD [5], 39.3 vs. 44.7 m; SGRQ score [9], 2 7.05 vs. 2 13.9 points). However, Zephyr EBV treatment has less morbidity than LVRS: pneumothorax requiring chest tube (EBV vs. LVRS: , 30% vs. . 90%), respiratory failure (EBV vs. LVRS: , 30% vs. . 90%), and pneumonia (EBV vs. LVRS: 4% vs. 18%). Speci fi cally, 90-day mortality after EBV is lower than LVRS with a rate of 3.1% compared with 5.0% in the LVRS non-high-risk group (39). Although the risks associated with LVRS are considered acceptable, this approach remains relatively underused (40). The only other remaining alternative of lung transplantation has a limitation of strict patient eligibility superimposed over the limited availability of donor lungs (41).\n\n## onclusions\n\nZephyr EBV treatment in carefully selected patients with little or no collateral ventilation in the target lobe provides clinically meaningful and statistically signi fi cant bene fi ts in lung function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life over current SoC medical therapy out to at least 12 months. The bene fi ts are comparable with those seen with LVRS but with a reduction in post-procedure morbidity. BLVR with the Zephyr EBV provides a viable treatment option for patients with severe emphysema and hyperin fl ation. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.\nAcknowledgment: The authors thank Marie Barrigar and the Team at NAMSA (Minneapolis, MN) and Asa Andersson, M.Sc., and the Team at Devicia AB (M ̈ olndal, Sweden) for providing oversight and data monitoring for this study, and Lori Davis, Ph.D., and the Team at QST Consultations, Ltd.

Primary outcome at 12 months was the D EBV -SoC of subjects with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 improvement from baseline of greater than or equal to 15%. Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in postbronchodilator FEV1, 6-minute-walk distance, and St. George ' s Respiratory Questionnaire scores.\nMeasurements and Main Results: A total of 190 subjects (128 EBV and 62 SoC) were randomized. At 12 months, 47.7% EBV and 16.8% SoC subjects had a D FEV1 greater than or equal to 15% ( P ,\n0.001). D EBV -SoC at 12 months was statistically and clinically signi fi cant: for FEV1, 0.106 L ( P , 0.001); 6-minute-walk distance, 1 39.31 m ( P = 0.002); and St. George ' s Respiratory Questionnaire, 2 7.05 points ( P = 0.004). Signi fi cant D EBV -SoC were also observed in hyperin fl ation (residual volume, 2 522 ml; P , 0.001), modi fi ed Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale ( 2 0.8 points; P , 0.001), and the BODE (body mass index, air fl ow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity) index ( 2 1.2 points). Pneumothorax was the most commonserious adverse event in the treatment period (procedure to 45 d), in 34/128 (26.6%) of EBV subjects. Four deaths occurred in the EBV group during this phase, and one each in the EBV and SoC groups between 46 days and 12 months.\nConclusions: Zephyr EBV provides clinically meaningful bene fi ts in lung function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life out to at least 12 months, with an acceptable safety pro fi le in patients with little or no collateral ventilation in the target lobe.\nClinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01796392).\nKeywords: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; emphysema; lung reduction\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) is the third leading cause of mortality in the United States with 15.4 million physician visits, 1.5 million emergency department visits, and 726,000 hospitalizations each year (1). Patients with advanced emphysema, one of the diseases that comprises Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are characterized by hyperin fl ation that precipitates breathlessness and predisposes\nindividuals to exacerbations and has a greater negative impact on health status than self-reported cardiovascular disease and diabetes (2, 3).\nMany surgical procedures have been devised to treat this disease including costochondrectomy, phrenic crush, pneumoperitoneum, pleural abrasion, surgical lung denervation, and thoracoplasty. But apart from lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), bullectomy, and lung transplantation all others have not proven to be viable (4). LVRS has been extensively studied, and in appropriately selected patients reduces hyperin fl ation improving lung function, dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and long-term survival (5 -7). However, LVRS is underused because of concerns about the invasiveness of the procedure, increased associated perioperative morbidity and mortality, and narrow patient eligibility criteria (8 -10). Zephyr Endobronchial Valves (Zephyr EBV, Pulmonx Corporation) are small duckbill valves inserted bronchoscopically into the lung to occlude an emphysematous lobe. Lobar de fl ation from the EBV leads to partial or full lobar atelectasis, thus reducing hyperin fl ation and mimicking the mechanisms of LVRS.\nIn the fi rst randomized controlled trial of Zephyr EBV, VENT (Endobronchial Valve for Emphysema Palliation Trial), the coprimary endpoints of FEV1 and 6-minute-walk distance (6MWD) achieved statistical but not clinically meaningful improvements between groups (11). Post hoc analysis showed that only patients with complete fi ssures in the treated lung and in whom lobar occlusion (occlusive positioning of valves in all segmental and subsegmental airways feeding the\ntarget lobe) was achieved had clinically meaningful outcomes (12, 13).\nAfter VENT, subsequent short-term studies with Zephyr EBV have shown that by selecting patients with little to no collateral ventilation between target and ipsilateral lobes and performing post-procedure con fi rmation of lobar occlusion, similar bene fi ts to LVRS can be achieved in patients with heterogeneous or homogeneous emphysema (14 -17) but with less morbidity. All these studies included a control arm and followed subjects out to 3 or 6 months.\nLIBERATE (Pulmonx Endobronchial Valves Used in Treatment of Emphysema) is the fi rst large randomized controlled multicenter international study conducted in patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema and with little to no collateral ventilation in the target lung to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and durability of bene fi t out to 12 months. The study compared Zephyr EBV treatment with standard medical management to standard medical management alone.\nSome of the results have been previously reported in the form of an abstract (18).", "category": "abstract", "level": null, "page_start": null, "page_end": null, "section_id": null}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "This trial (NCT01796392) conducted under a U.S. Food and Drug Administration -approved Investigational Device Exemption for the Zephyr EBV enrolled patients between October 2013 and September 2016 at 24 sites (18 sites in the United States and 6 sites outside the United States).

Assuming a two-sided 0.05 a level, study power of 90%, and 2:1 allocation random assignment, a sample size of 147 was expected to be adequate to test for superiority. The study sample size was increased to 183 to allow for 20% lost to follow-up and incomplete data. Each study site was allowed to enroll a maximum of 25 study participants.\nEligible emphysema patients were exsmokers between 40 and 75 years of age, with post-bronchodilator (BD) FEV1 between 15% and 45% predicted, TLC greater than 100% predicted, residual volume (RV) greater than or equal to 175% predicted, DL CO greater than or equal to 20% predicted, and a 6MWD between 100 and 500 m after a supervised pulmonary rehabilitation program (complete inclusion and exclusion criteria provided in Section E1 in the online supplement). Target lobe selection was based on a greater than 50% destruction score (percentage of voxels less than 2 910 Houns fi eld units on computed tomography [CT]) and heterogeneous emphysema de fi ned as absolute difference of 15 or greater in destruction scores between the targeted and ipsilateral lobes determined by investigational sites using Myrian quantitative software (Intrasense; see Figure E1).\nEligible patients were assessed with the Chartis to determine collateral ventilation status between targeted and adjacent lobes before randomization (19) (additional details provided in Section E2). Figure E2 shows examples of ' collateral ventilation negative ' and ' collateral ventilation positive ' assessments on Chartis. Subjects deemed to have a ' collateral ventilation negative ' target lobe by Chartis were randomized in a 2:1 fashion (blocked\ndesign) immediately after the Chartis assessment to either the EBV or standardof-care (SoC) groups ( see Section E3). The bronchoscopy procedure for subjects randomized to SoC was terminated after the Chartis assessment and subjects recovered per institutional clinical practice. Subjects randomized to EBV underwent placement of Zephyr EBV valves during the same session with the intent to achieve complete lobar occlusion (20). Subjects assessed as ' collateral ventilation positive ' were exited from the study ( see Section E2 for complete details).\nSubjects randomized to SoC were discharged after post-bronchoscopy recovery. Subjects randomized to EBV were hospitalized for 5 nights regardless of clinical status and underwent daily chest radiographs (with the fi rst taken within an hour of the bronchoscopy procedure) until discharge ( see Figure E3 for postrandomization follow-up of study subjects). Frequency of chest radiographs for any hospitalization for an adverse event was at the discretion of the physician, but a chest radiograph was required on the day of discharge. Clinical staff was trained regarding the risk of a pneumothorax; equipment needed to treat a pneumothorax was kept bedside. At discharge, subjects were provided a wrist-band denoting ' patient at risk of pneumothorax ' and were instructed to seek immediate medical attention in the event of symptoms of a potential pneumothorax.\nEBV subjects were contacted daily by telephone for 10 days after discharge; and evaluated during site visits at Day 7, Day 30, and Day 45 after discharge. At 45 days, a high-resolution CT scan was performed and assessed by an Independent Core Lab (MedQIA) to determine target lobe volume reduction (TLVR), and to verify whether complete lobar occlusion had been achieved. If necessary (TLVR , 50%, and incomplete lobar occlusion), a repeat bronchoscopy and valve revision/replacement was recommended. All subjects had clinical visits at 45 days and 3, 6 , 9, and 12 months after bronchoscopy. To reduce variability in the collection of the spirometry data, all study sites used the ERT MasterScope (eResearch Technology), a central diagnostic station attached to a spirometer to capture the FEV1 and FVC measurements ( see Section E4).

The results of the primary effectiveness endpoint are shown graphically in Figure 2.\nSecondary outcomes. All three secondary endpoints improved in favor of EBVand met statistical signi fi cance (Table 2 and Figure 3); the difference of means between EBV and SoC groups from baseline to 12 months for the absolute change in FEV1 was 0.106 L (17.96% for percent change in FEV1; P , 0.001) (Figure 3A), 6MWD was 39.3 m ( P = 0.002) (Figure 3B), and SGRQ was 2 7.05 points ( P = 0.004) (Figure 3C). Improvements in FEV1, 6MWD, and SGRQ score after EBV treatment were evident as early as 45 days after the procedure and persisted out to at least 12 months (Figure 4).\nThere were two measures at baseline that were imbalanced between the EBV and SoC groups at a two-sided 0.10 level, mMRC ( P = 0.091) and GOLD stage classi fi cation based on the percent predicted FEV1 ( P =0.037); however, there was no imbalance between groups based on FEV1.

Thus, neither of these variables had an impact on the primary or secondary effectiveness endpoints. The P value for the logistic regression with factors of treatment group, investigational site, and treatment group by investigational site interaction did not show any investigational site effect ( P = 0.785).\nA signi fi cantly greater percentage of subjects in the EBV group than in the SoC group met Odds ratio (or) exceeded the MCID for FEV1 (change of > 15% and > 12%), SGRQ (change of <2 4 points), and 6MWD (change of > 25 m), indicating meaningful clinical bene fi t was achieved (Figure 5; 6-mo responder data in Figure E4). Correspondingly, a higher percentage of subjects in the SoC group consistently either declined or had no change compared with the EBV group across these endpoints (Figure 6). Individual subject responses to each of these measures are presented graphically in Figure E5.\nAt 45 days after the procedure, 79.1% of subjects achieved a TLVR of greater than or equal to 350 ml, with a mean reduction of 1.03 6 0.68 L ( P , 0.001) and at 12 months, 84.2% of subjects achieved a TLVR of greater than or equal to 350 ml, with a mean reduction of 1.14 6 0.70 L ( P , 0.001) (Figure 5).\nConsistent with a durable TLVR at 12 months in the EBV group, there was a signi fi cant reduction in hyperin fl ation as measured by RV (decrease of 522 ml; P , 0.001; EBV -SoC) and RV/TLC ratio (decrease of 0.05; P , 0.001; EBV -SoC) (Table 2). At 12 months, RV decrease of 310 ml or more was achieved by 61.6% EBV subjects compared with 22.4% subjects in the SoC group (Figure 5). There was a signi fi cant improvement in gas exchange in the EBV compared with SoC groups (increase in DL CO of 0.870 ml CO/min/mm Hg; P = 0.013; EBV -SoC). The mMRC dyspnea score improved in favor of EBV with a between-group change of 2 0.8 points ( P , 0.001) with a greater number of subjects in the EBV group (47.8%) than in the SOC group (18.6%) meeting Odds ratio (or) exceeding the MCID of 2 1 point change; P , 0.001).\nSubjects in the EBV group had a greater reduction from baseline in the\nmulticomponent composite BODE index than those in the SoC group, with a mean difference between groups of 2 1.2 points ( P , 0.001) at 12 months.

Investigatorreported respiratory SAEs listed in Table 3 show that signi fi cantly more subjects in the EBV group (35.2%) than in the SoC group (4.8%) experienced respiratory SAEs in the treatment period (day of procedure/randomization to 45 d) immediately after the bronchoscopy procedure ( P , 0.001). This difference was primarily caused by a higher frequency of pneumothoraces in the EBV group during the treatment period, which were managed according to previously published and protocolized pneumothorax management algorithm (22) ( see Figure E6). Select respiratory SAEs with onset after the most\nrecent bronchoscopy procedure are summarized in Table E13.\nHowever, during the longer-term period ( . 46 d until 12-mo visit), the frequency of events was comparable between groups with 33.6% of the EBV group subjects and 30.6% of the SoC group subjects experiencing one or more respiratory SAEs.

Similar results have been reported previously (14 -17).\nExcept for a higher proportion of categorically de fi ned GOLD stage IV\nsubjects in the SoC group, the EBV and SoC groups were well matched for baseline demographics and clinical characteristics; including mean post-BD FEV1. However, this difference did not impact either the primary or secondary effectiveness outcomes based on analysis of covariance with baseline GOLD stage as a covariate.\nThe study met its primary endpoint with 47.7% EBV subjects compared with 16.8% SoC subjects achieving an\nimprovement in FEV1 of greater than Odds ratio (or) equal to 15% ( P , 0.001). Although the MCID cut off for change in FEV1 is highly variable, ranging from 10% to 15% (23), this threshold of 15% for the responder analysis was based on discussion with the Food and Drug Administration as the a priori threshold that they required for the pivotal U.S. trial. The absolute difference in means for FEV1 of 0.106 L signi fi es a meaningful important clinical change (24).\nImportantly, 79.1% of patients in the EBV group achieved the MCID for TLVR at 45 days; and 84.2% at 12 months con fi rming proper patient selection with Chartis and successful lobar occlusion. The overall mean change in target lobe volume radiographically determined by highresolution CT at 12 months was a reduction of 1.14 L, which corresponded to a mean reduction in RV of 0.5 L (or a 10.38% decrease from baseline). TLVR and consequent reduction in RV are consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of EBV and are comparable with changes after LVRS (25).\nThe major signi fi cant side effect associated with the EBV procedure in the short-term treatment period was pneumothorax. Targeted lobar de fl ation likely causes in fl ation of the ipsilateral lobe, which can result in a tear of the already compromised parenchymal tissue of the emphysematous ipsilateral lobe, resulting in a pneumothorax.

Physicians performing EBV treatment must be trained on appropriate patient and lobe selection for treatment and anticipate and recognize a pneumothorax, which can be readily managed using standard approaches (22).\nThe difference between groups for the change from baseline to 12 months of 39 m in the 6MWD is meaningful and demonstrates the persistent bene fi t EBV treatment provides in improving exercise tolerance in this patient group (27 -29). The absolute mean change in 6MWD in the EBV group at 12 months compared with baseline was only 13 m. However, left untreated, the decline in 6MWD in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at GOLD stage III/IV would be expected to be signi fi cant over time (30). As an example, in the NETT (National Emphysema Treatment Trial) study, untreated control patients in the non -highrisk group showed declines of 40 m in the\n6MWD at 1 year (5). In this study, the 6MWD in the SoC group declined by 26.3 m from baseline to 12 months. Although there was a wide range of baseline 6MWD, there was no correlation between baseline 6MWD and key outcomes of FEV1, 6MWD, or SGRQ in contrast to NETT where substantial bene fi t was seen only in patients with low exercise tolerance (31).

An additional important outcome in LIBERATE is the strong signal for the potential to reduce respiratory failure and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations requiring hospitalization in the longer term, both being important goals of therapy for these patients. Taken together with the previous demonstration of its effectiveness in patients with both heterogeneous (14, 15, 17) and homogeneous (15, 16) emphysema selected for little to no collateral ventilation, unilateral EBV treatment now provides a\nviable treatment option for a group of patients with emphysema that is currently lacking. Unlike surgery or other bronchoscopic interventions (33 -36) EBVs are readily removable, allowing the procedure to be reversed if a patient does not respond or has complications.\nThe 27% frequency of pneumothorax SAEs in the treatment period is consistent with previous studies (16, 17) and the occurrence of pneumothorax does not seem to negatively impact clinical outcomes as seen in this study and previously reported by Gompelmann and coworkers (26) and Kemp and coworkers (17). Seventy-six percent of the pneumothoraces occurred within 3 days after the most recent bronchoscopy (index procedure for those who did not have a secondary bronchoscopy), and 85% were within 5 days after the most recent bronchoscopy procedure. These statistics support a minimum 3-day hospital stay after EBV procedure to ensure timely management of a pneumothorax if it occurs. As in previous studies, the speci fi c algorithm for managing pneumothorax after EBV procedures developed by experts (22) was used to manage this consequence of the procedure during the present study and highlights the need for physicians performing\nthis procedure to have expertise in the management of procedural complications. One pneumothorax-related death at 13 days post-EBV procedure underlines the need to provide patients with clear instructions on recognizing symptoms of a pneumothorax and to seek emergent help if experiencing these symptoms.\nThe study has certain limitations. First, although many subjects did not meet the very strict inclusion/exclusion criteria that included baseline lung function measures, prior medical history, and so forth, 40% (280/706) of the screen failures were related to destruction score and heterogeneity requirements, the thresholds for which were arbitrarily chosen at the time the study was designed. Subsequent experience with homogenous patients in other trials (15, 16) has established the applicability of this therapy to a broader population. Similarly, the inclusion of subjects with little or no collateral ventilation was limited to their assessment with Chartis, which uses physiologic measures of air fl ow and airway resistance for assessing collateral ventilation status. The more recent evolution of novel quantitative CT (QCT) techniques now enables the noninvasive screening of subjects for collateral ventilation, with immediate exclusion of subjects with less than 80% complete fi ssure on QCT, Chartis requirement only in subjects with greater than 80% to less than 95% complete fi ssure on QCT, and treatment with EBV of subjects with greater than 95% complete fi ssure on QCT without Chartis (37, 38). This approach could have streamlined the screening out of subjects with completely absent fi ssures and perhaps reduced some screening bronchoscopies in this study.\nA second limitation of the study was allowing a repeat bronchoscopy for valve revision/replacement only in subjects with TLVR less than 50%, and incomplete lobar occlusion based on the 45-day CT assessment by the Imaging Core Lab. These dual criteria were too restrictive and prevented many subjects from potentially bene fi tting from a revision procedure. In clinical practice (20), repeat bronchoscopies for valve revision are performed based on clinical judgment if a patient has a lack of clinical response or experiences a sudden late loss of bene fi t.\nThe observed bene fi t to risk pro fi le of EBVtreatment must be assessed considering the limited treatment options for patients\nwith severe emphysema. LIBERATE shows improvements over nontreated control subjects at the same magnitude as those seen after LVRS (EBV vs. LVRS: FEV1 [29], 17% vs. 19%; 6MWD [5], 39.3 vs. 44.7 m; SGRQ score [9], 2 7.05 vs. 2 13.9 points). However, Zephyr EBV treatment has less morbidity than LVRS: pneumothorax requiring chest tube (EBV vs. LVRS: , 30% vs. . 90%), respiratory failure (EBV vs. LVRS: , 30% vs. . 90%), and pneumonia (EBV vs. LVRS: 4% vs. 18%). Speci fi cally, 90-day mortality after EBV is lower than LVRS with a rate of 3.1% compared with 5.0% in the LVRS non-high-risk group (39). Although the risks associated with LVRS are considered acceptable, this approach remains relatively underused (40). The only other remaining alternative of lung transplantation has a limitation of strict patient eligibility superimposed over the limited availability of donor lungs (41).", "category": "other", "level": null, "page_start": null, "page_end": null, "section_id": null}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "Zephyr EBV treatment in carefully selected patients with little or no collateral ventilation in the target lobe provides clinically meaningful and statistically signi fi cant bene fi ts in lung function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life over current SoC medical therapy out to at least 12 months.

Primary outcome at 12 months was the D EBV -SoC of subjects with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 improvement from baseline of greater than or equal to 15%. Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in postbronchodilator FEV1, 6-minute-walk distance, and St. George ' s Respiratory Questionnaire scores.\nMeasurements and Main Results: A total of 190 subjects (128 EBV and 62 SoC) were randomized. At 12 months, 47.7% EBV and 16.8% SoC subjects had a D FEV1 greater than or equal to 15% ( P ,\n0.001). D EBV -SoC at 12 months was statistically and clinically signi fi cant: for FEV1, 0.106 L ( P , 0.001); 6-minute-walk distance, 1 39.31 m ( P = 0.002); and St. George ' s Respiratory Questionnaire, 2 7.05 points ( P = 0.004). Signi fi cant D EBV -SoC were also observed in hyperin fl ation (residual volume, 2 522 ml; P , 0.001), modi fi ed Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale ( 2 0.8 points; P , 0.001), and the BODE (body mass index, air fl ow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity) index ( 2 1.2 points). Pneumothorax was the most commonserious adverse event in the treatment period (procedure to 45 d), in 34/128 (26.6%) of EBV subjects. Four deaths occurred in the EBV group during this phase, and one each in the EBV and SoC groups between 46 days and 12 months.\nConclusions: Zephyr EBV provides clinically meaningful bene fi ts in lung function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life out to at least 12 months, with an acceptable safety pro fi le in patients with little or no collateral ventilation in the target lobe.\nClinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01796392).\nKeywords: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; emphysema; lung reduction\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) is the third leading cause of mortality in the United States with 15.4 million physician visits, 1.5 million emergency department visits, and 726,000 hospitalizations each year (1). Patients with advanced emphysema, one of the diseases that comprises Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are characterized by hyperin fl ation that precipitates breathlessness and predisposes\nindividuals to exacerbations and has a greater negative impact on health status than self-reported cardiovascular disease and diabetes (2, 3).\nMany surgical procedures have been devised to treat this disease including costochondrectomy, phrenic crush, pneumoperitoneum, pleural abrasion, surgical lung denervation, and thoracoplasty. But apart from lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), bullectomy, and lung transplantation all others have not proven to be viable (4). LVRS has been extensively studied, and in appropriately selected patients reduces hyperin fl ation improving lung function, dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and long-term survival (5 -7). However, LVRS is underused because of concerns about the invasiveness of the procedure, increased associated perioperative morbidity and mortality, and narrow patient eligibility criteria (8 -10). Zephyr Endobronchial Valves (Zephyr EBV, Pulmonx Corporation) are small duckbill valves inserted bronchoscopically into the lung to occlude an emphysematous lobe. Lobar de fl ation from the EBV leads to partial or full lobar atelectasis, thus reducing hyperin fl ation and mimicking the mechanisms of LVRS.\nIn the fi rst randomized controlled trial of Zephyr EBV, VENT (Endobronchial Valve for Emphysema Palliation Trial), the coprimary endpoints of FEV1 and 6-minute-walk distance (6MWD) achieved statistical but not clinically meaningful improvements between groups (11). Post hoc analysis showed that only patients with complete fi ssures in the treated lung and in whom lobar occlusion (occlusive positioning of valves in all segmental and subsegmental airways feeding the\ntarget lobe) was achieved had clinically meaningful outcomes (12, 13).\nAfter VENT, subsequent short-term studies with Zephyr EBV have shown that by selecting patients with little to no collateral ventilation between target and ipsilateral lobes and performing post-procedure con fi rmation of lobar occlusion, similar bene fi ts to LVRS can be achieved in patients with heterogeneous or homogeneous emphysema (14 -17) but with less morbidity. All these studies included a control arm and followed subjects out to 3 or 6 months.\nLIBERATE (Pulmonx Endobronchial Valves Used in Treatment of Emphysema) is the fi rst large randomized controlled multicenter international study conducted in patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema and with little to no collateral ventilation in the target lung to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and durability of bene fi t out to 12 months. The study compared Zephyr EBV treatment with standard medical management to standard medical management alone.\nSome of the results have been previously reported in the form of an abstract (18).\n\n## ethods\n\nThis trial (NCT01796392) conducted under a U.S. Food and Drug Administration -approved Investigational Device Exemption for the Zephyr EBV enrolled patients between October 2013 and September 2016 at 24 sites (18 sites in the United States and 6 sites outside the United States). The study was approved by the respective institutional review boards or ethics committees at each site and all participating subjects\n(Received in original form March 29, 2018; accepted in final form May 22, 2018)\nA complete list of members of the LIBERATE Study Group may be found before the beginning of the REFERENCES.\nSponsored and funded by Pulmonx Corporation (Redwood City, CA).\nAuthor Contributions: G.J.C. is the Principal Investigator of the study and collaborated on design of the study; advised on medical issues during the conduct of the study; actively recruited and treated patients in the study; and participated in acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of the data, and development of the manuscript.

The consent informed all subjects that their fi nal enrollment in the study would be determined after the bronchoscopy procedure for collateral ventilation assessment with the Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System (510K Cleared K111764; Pulmonx Corporation).\nThe sample size was estimated using the results from the VENT trial (U.S. and European cohorts) (11, 12). Based on the results of these studies, the responder rate (FEV1 improvement of > 15%) in the Zephyr EBV treatment group was expected to be approximately 35% at 1 year. The responder rate for the control group was not expected to exceed 10% at 1 year. Assuming a two-sided 0.05 a level, study power of 90%, and 2:1 allocation random assignment, a sample size of 147 was expected to be adequate to test for superiority. The study sample size was increased to 183 to allow for 20% lost to follow-up and incomplete data. Each study site was allowed to enroll a maximum of 25 study participants.\nEligible emphysema patients were exsmokers between 40 and 75 years of age, with post-bronchodilator (BD) FEV1 between 15% and 45% predicted, TLC greater than 100% predicted, residual volume (RV) greater than or equal to 175% predicted, DL CO greater than or equal to 20% predicted, and a 6MWD between 100 and 500 m after a supervised pulmonary rehabilitation program (complete inclusion and exclusion criteria provided in Section E1 in the online supplement). Target lobe selection was based on a greater than 50% destruction score (percentage of voxels less than 2 910 Houns fi eld units on computed tomography [CT]) and heterogeneous emphysema de fi ned as absolute difference of 15 or greater in destruction scores between the targeted and ipsilateral lobes determined by investigational sites using Myrian quantitative software (Intrasense; see Figure E1).\nEligible patients were assessed with the Chartis to determine collateral ventilation status between targeted and adjacent lobes before randomization (19) (additional details provided in Section E2). Figure E2 shows examples of ' collateral ventilation negative ' and ' collateral ventilation positive ' assessments on Chartis. Subjects deemed to have a ' collateral ventilation negative ' target lobe by Chartis were randomized in a 2:1 fashion (blocked\ndesign) immediately after the Chartis assessment to either the EBV or standardof-care (SoC) groups ( see Section E3). The bronchoscopy procedure for subjects randomized to SoC was terminated after the Chartis assessment and subjects recovered per institutional clinical practice. Subjects randomized to EBV underwent placement of Zephyr EBV valves during the same session with the intent to achieve complete lobar occlusion (20). Subjects assessed as ' collateral ventilation positive ' were exited from the study ( see Section E2 for complete details).\nSubjects randomized to SoC were discharged after post-bronchoscopy recovery. Subjects randomized to EBV were hospitalized for 5 nights regardless of clinical status and underwent daily chest radiographs (with the fi rst taken within an hour of the bronchoscopy procedure) until discharge ( see Figure E3 for postrandomization follow-up of study subjects). Frequency of chest radiographs for any hospitalization for an adverse event was at the discretion of the physician, but a chest radiograph was required on the day of discharge. Clinical staff was trained regarding the risk of a pneumothorax; equipment needed to treat a pneumothorax was kept bedside. At discharge, subjects were provided a wrist-band denoting ' patient at risk of pneumothorax ' and were instructed to seek immediate medical attention in the event of symptoms of a potential pneumothorax.\nEBV subjects were contacted daily by telephone for 10 days after discharge; and evaluated during site visits at Day 7, Day 30, and Day 45 after discharge. At 45 days, a high-resolution CT scan was performed and assessed by an Independent Core Lab (MedQIA) to determine target lobe volume reduction (TLVR), and to verify whether complete lobar occlusion had been achieved. If necessary (TLVR , 50%, and incomplete lobar occlusion), a repeat bronchoscopy and valve revision/replacement was recommended. All subjects had clinical visits at 45 days and 3, 6 , 9, and 12 months after bronchoscopy. To reduce variability in the collection of the spirometry data, all study sites used the ERT MasterScope (eResearch Technology), a central diagnostic station attached to a spirometer to capture the FEV1 and FVC measurements ( see Section E4). EBV-treated subjects are planned for annual follow-up for an additional 4 years. After the 12-month\nevaluation, if eligible, SoC group subjects were given the option to crossover to EBV treatment with planned follow-up for an additional 5 years.\n\n## rimary Outcome\n\nThe primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects in the EBV group at 1 year after the procedure who had an improvement in the post-BD FEV1 of greater than or equal to 15% compared with the percentage of subjects achieving this improvement in the SoC group.\n\n## econdary Outcomes\n\nThe secondary outcomes included difference between EBV and SoC groups in the absolute change at 1 year in FEV1, St. George ' s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and 6MWD. Additional effectiveness measures included TLVR at 45 days and 1 year after the procedure, RV, inspiratory capacity, TLC, FRC, DL CO, modi fi ed Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC), BODE (body mass index, air fl ow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity) index, and for the EBV group only, the absolute and percent change in and the percentage of subjects achieving a TLVR minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of greater than Odds ratio (or) equal to 350 ml (19) relative to baseline.\nSafety was assessed in the treatment period (procedure through 45 d) and longer-term period (46 d through 1 yr) through review of all adverse events solicited at all scheduled or unscheduled visits. An independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) adjudicated serious adverse events (SAEs), device-related events, and select respiratory adverse events. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board provided study oversight to ensure patient rights and safety were respected and maintained.\n\n## tatistical Analyses\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS versions 9.3 (SAS Institute). The rationale for the sample size is provided in Section E5. Descriptive statistics included means, SD, and 95% con fi dence intervals. Continuous variables were compared with an analysis of covariance with the respective baseline value as the covariate, and categorical variables were compared with the Fisher exact test, a chi-square test, or a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Adverse event rates were compared using Poisson\nregression. An interim analysis was performed when 74 subjects had completed 12-month follow-up. To account for the interim analysis, the threshold for signi fi cance for the Z -statistic at 12 months\nwas Z greater than or equal to 2.004. The Hochberg step-up procedure was used to control for multiple secondary endpoint analyses (21). Additional details are provided in Section E6.\n\n## emographics\n\nA total of 190 subjects who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were\nDefinition of abbreviations : BMI = body mass index; BODE = BMI, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; EBV = Zephyr Endobronchial Valve; GOLD = Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease; HU = Hounsfield units; IC = inspiratory capacity; mMRC = modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale; NS = not significant; post-BD = post-bronchodilator; RV = residual volume; SGRQ = St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire; SoC = standard-of-care.\nValues are means\n6\nSD.\n*Emphysema destruction score was assessed as the percentage of voxels of less than 2 910 HU on computed tomography.\n† Heterogeneity index was assessed as the difference in the emphysema score between the target and the ipsilateral lobe.\n\n## RIGINAL ARTICLE\n\n' collateral ventilation negative ' for the target lobe according to Chartis assessment were randomized; 128 subjects (56 male/72 female) to EBV, and 62 subjects (33 male/29 female) to SoC ( see Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials diagram, Figure 1). Both groups were well matched for all baseline demographics and clinical characteristics, except for the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage classi fi cation, with more GOLD stage IV subjects in the SoC group ( P =0.037) (Table 1; see Tables E1 -E5).\n\n## rocedural Details\n\nA median of four valves (range, 2 -8) per subject were implanted in the 128 EBV subjects either under general anesthesia (64.8%) or conscious sedation (35.2%). Distribution of treated lobes was 66.4% left upper lobe, 11.7% left lower lobe, 10.9% right upper lobe, 6.3% right upper and right middle lobe combined, and 4.7% right lower lobe ( see Table E6 for procedural details). Sixteen subjects (12.5%) with incomplete lobar occlusion and TLVR less than 50% veri fi ed through the highresolution CT assessment at 45 days were eligible for valve adjustment; an additional two subjects were considered for valve adjustment by the investigator. Of these, 11 subjects underwent valve-adjustment procedures ( see Table E7). A total of 35 subjects underwent 54 secondary procedures of which 11 procedures were for the protocol-allowed adjustment after veri fi cation of lobar occlusion, 28 procedures were for valve removals and/or subsequent valve replacement after an adverse event (adverse events requiring valve removal included 12 pneumothorax, two increased dyspnea, one respiratory failure, one hypoxemia, one subcutaneous emphysema, and one valve migration), 12 procedures were for clinical investigation ( fi ve for inspection of valves because of loss of atelectasis, three for lavage to clear mucus, four to investigate blood in sputum), and the remaining three procedures were for patient-requested valve removals for perceived lack of bene fi t. Eight subjects had all valves removed before to the 12-month evaluation.\n\n## utcomes\n\nPrimary outcome. At 12 months after the procedure, 47.7% of the EBV subjects compared with 16.8% SoC subjects had a\ngreater than or equal to 15% increase over baseline in post-BD FEV1, with a betweengroup absolute difference of 31.0 (95% con fi dence interval, 18.0 -43.9%; P , 0.001; intention-to-treat). The results of the primary effectiveness endpoint are shown graphically in Figure 2.\nSecondary outcomes. All three secondary endpoints improved in favor of EBVand met statistical signi fi cance (Table 2 and Figure 3); the difference of means between EBV and SoC groups from baseline to 12 months for the absolute change in FEV1 was 0.106 L (17.96% for percent change in FEV1; P , 0.001) (Figure 3A), 6MWD was 39.3 m ( P = 0.002) (Figure 3B), and SGRQ was 2 7.05 points ( P = 0.004) (Figure 3C). Improvements in FEV1, 6MWD, and SGRQ score after EBV treatment were evident as early as 45 days after the procedure and persisted out to at least 12 months (Figure 4).\nThere were two measures at baseline that were imbalanced between the EBV and SoC groups at a two-sided 0.10 level, mMRC ( P = 0.091) and GOLD stage classi fi cation based on the percent predicted FEV1 ( P =0.037); however, there was no imbalance between groups based on FEV1. The interaction terms from logistic regression or from analysis of covariance with factors of treatment group and baseline value for mMRC or GOLD stage classi fi cation as covariate were not signi fi cant for the primary endpoint ( P = 0.799 and P = 0.906 for mMRC and GOLD, respectively), or any of the secondary endpoints. Thus, neither of these variables had an impact on the primary or secondary effectiveness endpoints. The P value for the logistic regression with factors of treatment group, investigational site, and treatment group by investigational site interaction did not show any investigational site effect ( P = 0.785).\nA signi fi cantly greater percentage of subjects in the EBV group than in the SoC group met Odds ratio (or) exceeded the MCID for FEV1 (change of > 15% and > 12%), SGRQ (change of <2 4 points), and 6MWD (change of > 25 m), indicating meaningful clinical bene fi t was achieved (Figure 5; 6-mo responder data in Figure E4). Correspondingly, a higher percentage of subjects in the SoC group consistently either declined or had no change compared with the EBV group across these endpoints (Figure 6). Individual subject responses to each of these measures are presented graphically in Figure E5.\nAt 45 days after the procedure, 79.1% of subjects achieved a TLVR of greater than or equal to 350 ml, with a mean reduction of 1.03 6 0.68 L ( P , 0.001) and at 12 months, 84.2% of subjects achieved a TLVR of greater than or equal to 350 ml, with a mean reduction of 1.14 6 0.70 L ( P , 0.001) (Figure 5).\nConsistent with a durable TLVR at 12 months in the EBV group, there was a signi fi cant reduction in hyperin fl ation as measured by RV (decrease of 522 ml; P , 0.001; EBV -SoC) and RV/TLC ratio (decrease of 0.05; P , 0.001; EBV -SoC) (Table 2). At 12 months, RV decrease of 310 ml or more was achieved by 61.6% EBV subjects compared with 22.4% subjects in the SoC group (Figure 5). There was a signi fi cant improvement in gas exchange in the EBV compared with SoC groups (increase in DL CO of 0.870 ml CO/min/mm Hg; P = 0.013; EBV -SoC). The mMRC dyspnea score improved in favor of EBV with a between-group change of 2 0.8 points ( P , 0.001) with a greater number of subjects in the EBV group (47.8%) than in the SOC group (18.6%) meeting Odds ratio (or) exceeding the MCID of 2 1 point change; P , 0.001).\nSubjects in the EBV group had a greater reduction from baseline in the\nmulticomponent composite BODE index than those in the SoC group, with a mean difference between groups of 2 1.2 points ( P , 0.001) at 12 months. More subjects in the EBV than in the SoC group were responders achieving a MCID change of 2 1 point Odds ratio (or) less (58.0% vs. 24.1%, respectively; P , 0.001) (Figure 6). Supplemental oxygen usage at 12 months in the EBV and SoC group subjects was evaluated to compare change in oxygen usage from baseline. A larger proportion of EBV subjects than SoC subjects (15.7% vs. 6.9%, respectively) used less oxygen, whereas a larger proportion of SoC subjects\nthan EBV subjects (22.4% vs. 11.3%, respectively) used more oxygen, at 12 months than their baseline usage; the distribution of oxygen change categories was statistically signi fi cant ( P = 0.019) when comparing EBV with SoC ( see Table E8).\n\n## ubjects with no valves at 12-month\n\nevaluation. Eight subjects who had all valves removed before their 12-month evaluation ( fi ve for a pneumothorax, two for increased dyspnea, and one for pneumonia) did not\nachieve any bene fi t when compared with EBV subjects with valves ( see Table E9). Outcomes for subjects with no valves at 12 months were not dissimilar from the SoC group (Table 2).\nType of anesthesia used. The percent of subjects achieving an FEV1 improvement of greater than or equal to 15% based on the type of anesthesia used for the EBV procedure were similar with 49.2% in the conscious sedation group and 46.9% in the general anesthesia group. Adverse events occurring at a frequency of 3% or greater for the subgroups of anesthesia type are provided in Table E10.\nDefinition of abbreviations : 6MWD=6-minute-walk distance; BODE = body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity; CI = confidence interval; EBV = Zephyr Endobronchial Valve; IC = inspiratory capacity; mMRC = modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale; NA = not applicable; post-BD = post-bronchodilator; RV = residual volume; SGRQ = St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire; SoC = standard-of-care; TLVR = target lobe volume reduction.\n\n## pper versus lower lobe treatments.\n\nSimilar bene fi ts were seen in the upper lobe and lower lobe subgroups with 45.9% upper lobe treated subjects and 57.1% lower lobe treated subjects with an FEV1 improvement of greater than or equal to 15%. The secondary endpoint results for these subgroups are provided in Table E11.\n\n## dverse Events\n\nA summary of all adverse events occurring at a frequency of 3% or more is provided in Table E12. Of the 501 EBVs that were implanted, two EBVs (in two subjects) were expectorated and three EBVs (in three subjects) migrated throughout the 12month follow-up for a 0.4% expectoration rate and 0.6% migration rate. Investigatorreported respiratory SAEs listed in Table 3 show that signi fi cantly more subjects in the EBV group (35.2%) than in the SoC group (4.8%) experienced respiratory SAEs in the treatment period (day of procedure/randomization to 45 d) immediately after the bronchoscopy procedure ( P , 0.001). This difference was primarily caused by a higher frequency of pneumothoraces in the EBV group during the treatment period, which were managed according to previously published and protocolized pneumothorax management algorithm (22) ( see Figure E6). Select respiratory SAEs with onset after the most\nrecent bronchoscopy procedure are summarized in Table E13.\nHowever, during the longer-term period ( . 46 d until 12-mo visit), the frequency of events was comparable between groups with 33.6% of the EBV group subjects and 30.6% of the SoC group subjects experiencing one or more respiratory SAEs. During the longerterm period (Table 3), there was a lower frequency of SAEs (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, pneumonias, and respiratory failure) in the EBV group than in the SoC group (23.0% vs. 30.6%, 5.7% vs. 8.1%, and 0.8% vs. 3.2%, respectively), although none of these differences reached statistical signi fi cance. Over the 12-month follow-up, there were no episodes of hemoptysis (de fi ned as . 200 ml blood loss in , 24 h).\nTable 4 shows the rates of respiratory SAEs (i.e., annualized rates based on the time of occurrence). Investigator-reported event rates are compared with the CEC adjudicated event rates; CEC adjudication removed any investigator bias on nomenclature and attribution of adverse events by using standardized de fi nitions. Based on the CEC adjudication, during the treatment period, only the pneumothorax rate was signi fi cantly different between groups with 0.275 events/45 days in the EBV group compared with no events in the SoC group ( P , 0.001). During the longer-term period, CEC-adjudicated\npneumothorax rates continued to be signi fi cantly different between groups with 0.074 events/yr compared with no events in the SoC group ( P = 0.013). However, during the longer-term period, serious Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations and respiratory failure events rates trended to be lower in the EBV group than in the SoC group with 0.352 events/yr compared with 0.573 events/yr ( P = 0.053) and 0.019 events/yr compared with 0.099 events/yr ( P = 0.033), respectively.\n\n## neumothorax\n\nThe major post-procedural complication was pneumothorax with 46 pneumothorax events occurring in 44 EBV subjects (34.4%) during the 12-month period. Eight of these events did not require any intervention (observation only). A total of 38 of the 46 pneumothoraces (83%) were managed with a placement of a chest tube; 12 of these events also required the removal of at least one valve. None of the pneumothoraces occurring in the longerterm period required the removal of any valves for their management. A total of 43 of the 46 pneumothoraces occurred within 13 days of a recent bronchoscopy procedure, of which 35 (76%) occurred within the fi rst 3 days as shown in Figure 7, for a median event onset time of 1.0 day from a recent bronchoscopy procedure.\nSubjects with pneumothorax ( n =44) experienced similar bene fi ts at 12 months to subjects without a pneumothorax ( n =84);\n( see Table E14). Exploratory analyses of subjects who experienced either a ' complex ' pneumothorax (de fi ned by either death or removal of all EBVs) or a ' simple ' pneumothorax (all other pneumothoraces) showed that subjects were at higher risk of a ' complex ' pneumothorax if the lobe with maximum destruction score is not treated, and the nontreated contralateral lung destruction score is greater than 60%. Qualitative assessment of CTs of the EBV group by an independent thoracic radiologist (Imaging Core Lab) of radiologic features that included presence or absence of pleural adhesions, intraparenchymal scars, blebs, bullae, and paraseptal cysts in target and\nnontarget lobes did not identify any variable that was statistically signi fi cant in predicting the occurrence of a pneumothorax.\n\n## ortality\n\nDuring the treatment period, there were four deaths in the EBV group (3.1% of subjects; three from a pneumothorax on Day 3, Day 3, and Day 13, and one from respiratory failure on Day 11) compared with none in the SoC group. The three pneumothorax-related deaths occurred in subjects who were not treated in the most diseased lobe. Of the four deaths in the EBV group, three were considered ' de fi nitely related ' and one ' probably related ' to the\nEBV treatment. During the longer-term period, there was one death (0.8%) in the EBV group on Day 147 resulting from a Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation that was not related to the device, and one cardiac arrhythmia related in the SoC group (1.6%) on Day 141.\n\n## iscussion\n\nBronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) with Zephyr EBV is a breakthrough approach for reducing hyperin fl ation in patients with severe emphysema. This multicenter randomized controlled trial demonstrates that Zephyr EBV treatment in\nB\nC\nD\nSix-Minute Walk Distance (meters)\npatients with severe emphysema selected for little to no collateral ventilation between the treated and the ipsilateral lobe resulted in signi fi cant lobar volume reduction, with consequent reduction in hyperin fl ation, and clinically meaningful improvements in dyspnea, lung function, exercise-capacity, and quality of life. Similar results have been reported previously (14 -17).\nExcept for a higher proportion of categorically de fi ned GOLD stage IV\nsubjects in the SoC group, the EBV and SoC groups were well matched for baseline demographics and clinical characteristics; including mean post-BD FEV1. However, this difference did not impact either the primary or secondary effectiveness outcomes based on analysis of covariance with baseline GOLD stage as a covariate.\nThe study met its primary endpoint with 47.7% EBV subjects compared with 16.8% SoC subjects achieving an\nimprovement in FEV1 of greater than Odds ratio (or) equal to 15% ( P , 0.001). Although the MCID cut off for change in FEV1 is highly variable, ranging from 10% to 15% (23), this threshold of 15% for the responder analysis was based on discussion with the Food and Drug Administration as the a priori threshold that they required for the pivotal U.S. trial. The absolute difference in means for FEV1 of 0.106 L signi fi es a meaningful important clinical change (24).\nImportantly, 79.1% of patients in the EBV group achieved the MCID for TLVR at 45 days; and 84.2% at 12 months con fi rming proper patient selection with Chartis and successful lobar occlusion. The overall mean change in target lobe volume radiographically determined by highresolution CT at 12 months was a reduction of 1.14 L, which corresponded to a mean reduction in RV of 0.5 L (or a 10.38% decrease from baseline). TLVR and consequent reduction in RV are consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of EBV and are comparable with changes after LVRS (25).\nThe major signi fi cant side effect associated with the EBV procedure in the short-term treatment period was pneumothorax. Targeted lobar de fl ation likely causes in fl ation of the ipsilateral lobe, which can result in a tear of the already compromised parenchymal tissue of the emphysematous ipsilateral lobe, resulting in a pneumothorax. As seen in this study and reported previously (17, 26) subjects experiencing a pneumothorax attained the same level of bene fi t over the long-term as those without pneumothorax. The three\n\n## esponders at 12-Months\n\npneumothorax-related deaths that occurred in subjects that were not treated in the most diseased lobe because of the heterogeneity requirement (difference in heterogeneity score of 15 between target and ipsilateral lobes) and the absence of collateral ventilation may imply that subjects with reduced capacity in the nontreated contralateral lung experience higher risk from the insult of single-lung ventilation during the pneumothorax event. Physicians performing EBV treatment must be trained on appropriate patient and lobe selection for treatment and anticipate and recognize a pneumothorax, which can be readily managed using standard approaches (22).\nThe difference between groups for the change from baseline to 12 months of 39 m in the 6MWD is meaningful and demonstrates the persistent bene fi t EBV treatment provides in improving exercise tolerance in this patient group (27 -29). The absolute mean change in 6MWD in the EBV group at 12 months compared with baseline was only 13 m. However, left untreated, the decline in 6MWD in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at GOLD stage III/IV would be expected to be signi fi cant over time (30). As an example, in the NETT (National Emphysema Treatment Trial) study, untreated control patients in the non -highrisk group showed declines of 40 m in the\n6MWD at 1 year (5). In this study, the 6MWD in the SoC group declined by 26.3 m from baseline to 12 months. Although there was a wide range of baseline 6MWD, there was no correlation between baseline 6MWD and key outcomes of FEV1, 6MWD, or SGRQ in contrast to NETT where substantial bene fi t was seen only in patients with low exercise tolerance (31). Although not powered to demonstrate this change, there was a reduction in the rate of respiratory failure events ( P = 0.033) and a trend for a reduction in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations resulting in hospitalizations ( P = 0.053) and in the longer-term period between EBV and SoC.

An additional important outcome in LIBERATE is the strong signal for the potential to reduce respiratory failure and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations requiring hospitalization in the longer term, both being important goals of therapy for these patients. Taken together with the previous demonstration of its effectiveness in patients with both heterogeneous (14, 15, 17) and homogeneous (15, 16) emphysema selected for little to no collateral ventilation, unilateral EBV treatment now provides a\nviable treatment option for a group of patients with emphysema that is currently lacking. Unlike surgery or other bronchoscopic interventions (33 -36) EBVs are readily removable, allowing the procedure to be reversed if a patient does not respond or has complications.\nThe 27% frequency of pneumothorax SAEs in the treatment period is consistent with previous studies (16, 17) and the occurrence of pneumothorax does not seem to negatively impact clinical outcomes as seen in this study and previously reported by Gompelmann and coworkers (26) and Kemp and coworkers (17). Seventy-six percent of the pneumothoraces occurred within 3 days after the most recent bronchoscopy (index procedure for those who did not have a secondary bronchoscopy), and 85% were within 5 days after the most recent bronchoscopy procedure. These statistics support a minimum 3-day hospital stay after EBV procedure to ensure timely management of a pneumothorax if it occurs. As in previous studies, the speci fi c algorithm for managing pneumothorax after EBV procedures developed by experts (22) was used to manage this consequence of the procedure during the present study and highlights the need for physicians performing\nthis procedure to have expertise in the management of procedural complications. One pneumothorax-related death at 13 days post-EBV procedure underlines the need to provide patients with clear instructions on recognizing symptoms of a pneumothorax and to seek emergent help if experiencing these symptoms.\nThe study has certain limitations. First, although many subjects did not meet the very strict inclusion/exclusion criteria that included baseline lung function measures, prior medical history, and so forth, 40% (280/706) of the screen failures were related to destruction score and heterogeneity requirements, the thresholds for which were arbitrarily chosen at the time the study was designed. Subsequent experience with homogenous patients in other trials (15, 16) has established the applicability of this therapy to a broader population. Similarly, the inclusion of subjects with little or no collateral ventilation was limited to their assessment with Chartis, which uses physiologic measures of air fl ow and airway resistance for assessing collateral ventilation status. The more recent evolution of novel quantitative CT (QCT) techniques now enables the noninvasive screening of subjects for collateral ventilation, with immediate exclusion of subjects with less than 80% complete fi ssure on QCT, Chartis requirement only in subjects with greater than 80% to less than 95% complete fi ssure on QCT, and treatment with EBV of subjects with greater than 95% complete fi ssure on QCT without Chartis (37, 38). This approach could have streamlined the screening out of subjects with completely absent fi ssures and perhaps reduced some screening bronchoscopies in this study.\nA second limitation of the study was allowing a repeat bronchoscopy for valve revision/replacement only in subjects with TLVR less than 50%, and incomplete lobar occlusion based on the 45-day CT assessment by the Imaging Core Lab. These dual criteria were too restrictive and prevented many subjects from potentially bene fi tting from a revision procedure. In clinical practice (20), repeat bronchoscopies for valve revision are performed based on clinical judgment if a patient has a lack of clinical response or experiences a sudden late loss of bene fi t.\nThe observed bene fi t to risk pro fi le of EBVtreatment must be assessed considering the limited treatment options for patients\nwith severe emphysema. LIBERATE shows improvements over nontreated control subjects at the same magnitude as those seen after LVRS (EBV vs. LVRS: FEV1 [29], 17% vs. 19%; 6MWD [5], 39.3 vs. 44.7 m; SGRQ score [9], 2 7.05 vs. 2 13.9 points). However, Zephyr EBV treatment has less morbidity than LVRS: pneumothorax requiring chest tube (EBV vs. LVRS: , 30% vs. . 90%), respiratory failure (EBV vs. LVRS: , 30% vs. . 90%), and pneumonia (EBV vs. LVRS: 4% vs. 18%). Speci fi cally, 90-day mortality after EBV is lower than LVRS with a rate of 3.1% compared with 5.0% in the LVRS non-high-risk group (39). Although the risks associated with LVRS are considered acceptable, this approach remains relatively underused (40). The only other remaining alternative of lung transplantation has a limitation of strict patient eligibility superimposed over the limited availability of donor lungs (41).\n\n## onclusions\n\nZephyr EBV treatment in carefully selected patients with little or no collateral ventilation in the target lobe provides clinically meaningful and statistically signi fi cant bene fi ts in lung function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life over current SoC medical therapy out to at least 12 months. The bene fi ts are comparable with those seen with LVRS but with a reduction in post-procedure morbidity. BLVR with the Zephyr EBV provides a viable treatment option for patients with severe emphysema and hyperin fl ation. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.\nAcknowledgment: The authors thank Marie Barrigar and the Team at NAMSA (Minneapolis, MN) and Asa Andersson, M.Sc., and the Team at Devicia AB (M ̈ olndal, Sweden) for providing oversight and data monitoring for this study, and Lori Davis, Ph.D., and the Team at QST Consultations, Ltd.

Further trials are needed to assess the longterm outcomes of this new stent technology.\nKey Words: malignant central airway obstruction, stent, lung cancer\n( J Bronchol 2008;15:221-224)\nT racheobronchial stent placement has become a routine palliative modality for malignant airway obstruction. The goal is to improve airway lumen patency and quality of life. There are in general 2 classes of stents, silicone and metal. Silicone stents have been available and routinely used since the 1980s. 1,2 They are usually placed using a rigid bronchoscope, under general anesthesia, in the operating room. They have both positive and negative attributes. Advantages of silicone stents include the fact that there is much published data on their use. They are efficacious and inexpensive. In addition, these stents can be removed if needed. The disadvantages include: a need for general anesthesia and a trip to the operating room. In addition, granulation tissue formation around the stent and mucous formation within the stent is common.\nSelf-expanding metal stents, usually made up of nitinol frame that has shape memory, became popular in the 1990s. They have the advantage of being able to be placed in the bronchoscopy suite under local anesthesia under moderate sedation. The disadvantages include difficulty with removal, stent fracture, granulation tissue formation, and infection due to bacterial adherence to the covering.\nIn an attempt to capture the favorable properties of both classes of stents, a completely covered nitinol (hybrid) stent was designed to reduce stent complications (AERO stent, Alveolus Inc, Charlotte, NC) (Figure 1).\nThe purpose of our study was to assess the safety and efficacy of this new hybrid stent.\n\n## ETHODS\n\nThis was a multicenter prospective intention to treat trial. Eleven centers in the United States and Europe\nCopyright r 2008 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Reprints: Thomas R. Gildea, MD, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Desk A-90, Cleveland, OH 44195 (e-mail: gildeat@ccf.org).\nReceived for publication July 11, 2008; accepted July 23, 2008.

Inclusion criteria were patients greater than 18 years of age with malignant airway obstruction of the major airways, either extrinsic (Figure 2) or intrinsic (Figure 3). Patients needed a predicted life expectancy of greater than 90 days to be included in the\nstudy. Exclusion criteria included patients for whom bronchoscopy was contraindicated, those who had benign disease, and those in whom a guidewire could not be passed across the obstruction.\n\n## evice Description\n\nThe system is comprised of 2 components: a radiopaque self-expanding nitinol stent and the delivery\nDownloaded from http://journals.lww.com/bronchology by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4XMi0hC ywCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC1y0abggQZXdtwnfKZBYtws= on 07/18/2024\nsystem. The stent is completely covered with a biocompatible membrane, which minimizes the possibility of tissue in-growth and granuloma formation. A hydrophilic coating in the inner lumen of the stent shall minimize mucous adherence and accumulation. Because the device is cut from a tube of nitinol with a unique design, the stent does not foreshorten or elongate upon delivery. The stent has a slightly larger diameter near the distal and proximal ends (Figure 1). Both ends are slightly vaulted inwardly to minimize possible airway injury and the formation of granulation tissue at the stent edges.\nThe stent is deployed with a preloaded dedicated delivery system.\n\n## tudy End Points\n\nData were collected before bronchoscopy, immediately postbronchoscopy, and at a 7-day postimplant clinic visit. Telephone interviews were conducted at 30 and 90 days to assess improvement in dyspnea scores.\nImprovement in lumen patency was visually assessed by comparison of airway lumen diameter prestent and poststent implant. Success was defined by 50% reduction in stenosis. This assessment was independently confirmed by blinded investigators assessing prebronchoscopy and postbronchoscopy images.\nQuality of life was assessed using a Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) and Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI) 3 as a surrogate of quality of life measure. The TDI scores were indicative of improvement (positive integer), no change (score of 0), or deterioration (negative integer) in comparison to the BDI assessed before implant. A change in score of +1 or more indicates a clinically meaningful improvement. A change in score of /C0 1 or more indicates a clinically meaningful worsening of dyspnea.\nA 4-point Likert scale to indicate ease of use and deployment performance was also recorded with 1 being difficult to place and 4 being easy to place.\n\n## ESULTS\n\nSixty-one stents were placed in 56 patients. Patient characteristics and stent deployment location are reported in Table 1. Stents were deployed in the central airways. In all cases, palliative effects were observed. The average\ndegree of lumen occlusion before stent placement was 82%. Improvement in luminal patency was noted in 88% of patients as defined by an increase in luminal diameter of Z 50% ( P <0.05). Success is comparable with images seen in Figures 2 and 3. Dyspnea indices improved after stenting compared with baseline values with an average improvement of 2.9 at 7 days and 3.2 at 30 days ( P <0.05). Improvement at 90 days was not clinically significant ( P Z 0.05) (Table 2). Physician satisfaction with the deployment of the stent was high. Six aspects of the deployment system, including guidewire passage through the catheter, catheter passage into airway, stent release, catheter removal from airway, visualization, and accuracy of stent placement were rated on a 4-point scale where 4 = excellent and 1 = poor. A final average score between ''good'' (3) and ''excellent'' (4) was reported for each aspect with an overall average of 3.57. The stent was determined to be easily deployed.\nThe major complication of stent placement in this study was migration, which occurred in 28% of patients. Other minor stent-related complications included minimal granulation tissue in 5% (n = 3) and infection in 4% (n =2). Complications not related to the stent placement included pain in 7% (n=4) and hemoptysis in 4% (n =2). Tumor in-growth was not observed in this study.\nSurvival after stent placement was 54 (96%) at 7, 46 (82%) at 30 and 38 (68%) at 90 days. Seven patients had their stent removed for the following reasons: response to concomitant therapy resulting in tumor response (n = 2), granulation tissue formation (n = 3), tumor growth at the ends of the stent requiring further stent placement (n =1), and secretion build-up (n = 1).\n\n## ISCUSSION\n\nThis is the first prospective, multicenter evaluation of a new hybrid completely covered metallic framed\n\n## able 1.

The self-expanding hybrid stent provided immediate palliation in nearly all patients with a reasonable complication rate. It provides some of the strengths of both the silicone and metallic stents while eliminating some of the weaknesses. The self-expanding hybrid stent could be placed in the bronchoscopy laboratory under conscious sedation (a strength of selfexpanding metallic stents 4 ) but could be easily removed when needed (a strength of the silicone stent 4 ). The rate of immediate palliation is consistent with other studies in which metallic stents have been used. 5 Early complication rates are also consistent with published literature. In a study of 82 patients with benign and malignant disease, 54.8% of patients required additional procedures to control granulation tissue formation and disease recurrence (tumor in-growth) postimplant. 6 Another study which included 27 patients had an overall complication rate of 50%. Secretion retention in 18% of the patients required additional interventional procedures and 15% of the patients' experienced recurrent dyspnea from granulation tissue formation at the end of the stent. 7 In this study, we observed 3 instances of slight granulation tissue formation which did not require ablation, no instance of tumor in-growth and no occlusion by secretions, though larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. The rate of migration is higher than what one would see with metallic stents yet, within range of what is found with silicone stents. 5 Since the completion of this trial the stent has been modified and struts have been added to reduce the rate of migration. We have reasons to believe that this goal can be accomplished.\nThis study has several strengths. First, it was a prospective multicentered study that is rare for a trial, which evaluates airway stent technology. Second, many important clinical end points were captured. Improvement in luminal patency was blindly assessed. Dyspnea, a surrogate of quality of life, as assessed by the BDI/TDI, was evaluated prestent and poststent placement and complications were recorded out to 90 days. The study has some weaknesses, namely, that long-term follow-up beyond 90 days was not assessed. Not surprisingly in this cancer population, a number of patients died before the end of the study, though none were related to stent placement. Transitional dyspnea scores were not available for many of the patients at the 90-day follow-up due to inability to travel, entrance into hospice care, or loss to follow-up. Transitional dyspnea scores were not recorded for some patients at 7 and 30 days due to removal of the\ndevice or expiration. Additional studies are needed with a longer follow-up period to accurately assess this new stent technology.\nIn summary, the initial experience with this new hybrid stent was positive. The device was easy to deploy, effective in palliating symptoms and, when indicated, was easy to remove. The complication rate was comparable with that reported in the literature and repeat procedures were rarely required. Further trials are needed to assess the long-term outcomes of this new hybrid stent. Preferably, a study should be conducted comparing the new modified stent versus other stent types.\n\n## EFERENCES\n\n1. Westaby S, Shepherd MP.

Metal stents can be placed using flexible bronchoscopy under local anesthesia but may be difficult to remove. Silicone stents require rigid bronchoscopy and general anesthesia to place but they are relatively easy to remove. A new hybrid stent, the AERO stent (Alveolus Inc, Charlotte, NC), has a completely covered nitinol framework. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this new hybrid stent for the treatment of malignant airway obstruction.\nMethods: This was a prospective multicenter intention to treat study. Eligible patients with malignant airway obstruction underwent self-expanding hybrid stent placement at 11 centers between June 2005 and December 2006. Patients were evaluated immediately postprocedure and at 7, 30, and 90 days postprocedure. Ease of deployment was assessed on a 4-point Likert scale. Luminal patency was visually assessed preimplant and postimplant by investigators and verified in blinded review of photographs taken during the procedure. Quality of life was measured using the Baseline Dyspnea Index and Transitional Dyspnea Index.\nResults: Fifty-six patients (53% male, 47% female, median age 65.7) underwent stent placement. Physicians rated ease of deployment at 3.6 on a 1 to 4 scale with 1 being poor and 4 being excellent. Eighty-eight percent of patients had a lumen patency improvement of >50% ( P &<0.05). Dyspnea indices demonstrated quality of life improvement postimplant as compared with baseline values (average improvement in Transitional Dyspnea Index of 2.9 at 7d and 3.2 at 30d, P <0.05) Complications included hemoptysis, infection, granulation tissue formation, stent migration, and pain at rates comparable with previously published studies. Stent removal,\nwhen clinically indicated, was accomplished without difficulty or complication in 7 patients.\nConclusions: In patients with malignant airway obstruction, selfexpanding hybrid stent were easy to deploy and remove and improved luminal patency and quality of life with an acceptable complication rate. Further trials are needed to assess the longterm outcomes of this new stent technology.\nKey Words: malignant central airway obstruction, stent, lung cancer\n( J Bronchol 2008;15:221-224)\nT racheobronchial stent placement has become a routine palliative modality for malignant airway obstruction. The goal is to improve airway lumen patency and quality of life. There are in general 2 classes of stents, silicone and metal. Silicone stents have been available and routinely used since the 1980s. 1,2 They are usually placed using a rigid bronchoscope, under general anesthesia, in the operating room. They have both positive and negative attributes. Advantages of silicone stents include the fact that there is much published data on their use. They are efficacious and inexpensive. In addition, these stents can be removed if needed. The disadvantages include: a need for general anesthesia and a trip to the operating room. In addition, granulation tissue formation around the stent and mucous formation within the stent is common.\nSelf-expanding metal stents, usually made up of nitinol frame that has shape memory, became popular in the 1990s. They have the advantage of being able to be placed in the bronchoscopy suite under local anesthesia under moderate sedation. The disadvantages include difficulty with removal, stent fracture, granulation tissue formation, and infection due to bacterial adherence to the covering.\nIn an attempt to capture the favorable properties of both classes of stents, a completely covered nitinol (hybrid) stent was designed to reduce stent complications (AERO stent, Alveolus Inc, Charlotte, NC) (Figure 1).\nThe purpose of our study was to assess the safety and efficacy of this new hybrid stent.", "category": "other", "level": null, "page_start": null, "page_end": null, "section_id": null}, {"title": "METHODS", "content": "This was a multicenter prospective intention to treat trial.

The disadvantages include difficulty with removal, stent fracture, granulation tissue formation, and infection due to bacterial adherence to the covering.\nIn an attempt to capture the favorable properties of both classes of stents, a completely covered nitinol (hybrid) stent was designed to reduce stent complications (AERO stent, Alveolus Inc, Charlotte, NC) (Figure 1).\nThe purpose of our study was to assess the safety and efficacy of this new hybrid stent.\n\n## ETHODS\n\nThis was a multicenter prospective intention to treat trial.

Inclusion criteria were patients greater than 18 years of age with malignant airway obstruction of the major airways, either extrinsic (Figure 2) or intrinsic (Figure 3). Patients needed a predicted life expectancy of greater than 90 days to be included in the\nstudy. Exclusion criteria included patients for whom bronchoscopy was contraindicated, those who had benign disease, and those in whom a guidewire could not be passed across the obstruction.\n\n## evice Description\n\nThe system is comprised of 2 components: a radiopaque self-expanding nitinol stent and the delivery\nDownloaded from http://journals.lww.com/bronchology by BhDMf5ePHKav1zEoum1tQfN4a+kJLhEZgbsIHo4XMi0hC ywCX1AWnYQp/IlQrHD3i3D0OdRyi7TvSFl4Cf3VC1y0abggQZXdtwnfKZBYtws= on 07/18/2024\nsystem. The stent is completely covered with a biocompatible membrane, which minimizes the possibility of tissue in-growth and granuloma formation. A hydrophilic coating in the inner lumen of the stent shall minimize mucous adherence and accumulation. Because the device is cut from a tube of nitinol with a unique design, the stent does not foreshorten or elongate upon delivery. The stent has a slightly larger diameter near the distal and proximal ends (Figure 1). Both ends are slightly vaulted inwardly to minimize possible airway injury and the formation of granulation tissue at the stent edges.\nThe stent is deployed with a preloaded dedicated delivery system.\n\n## tudy End Points\n\nData were collected before bronchoscopy, immediately postbronchoscopy, and at a 7-day postimplant clinic visit. Telephone interviews were conducted at 30 and 90 days to assess improvement in dyspnea scores.\nImprovement in lumen patency was visually assessed by comparison of airway lumen diameter prestent and poststent implant. Success was defined by 50% reduction in stenosis. This assessment was independently confirmed by blinded investigators assessing prebronchoscopy and postbronchoscopy images.\nQuality of life was assessed using a Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) and Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI) 3 as a surrogate of quality of life measure. The TDI scores were indicative of improvement (positive integer), no change (score of 0), or deterioration (negative integer) in comparison to the BDI assessed before implant. A change in score of +1 or more indicates a clinically meaningful improvement. A change in score of /C0 1 or more indicates a clinically meaningful worsening of dyspnea.\nA 4-point Likert scale to indicate ease of use and deployment performance was also recorded with 1 being difficult to place and 4 being easy to place.\n\n## ESULTS\n\nSixty-one stents were placed in 56 patients. Patient characteristics and stent deployment location are reported in Table 1. Stents were deployed in the central airways. In all cases, palliative effects were observed. The average\ndegree of lumen occlusion before stent placement was 82%. Improvement in luminal patency was noted in 88% of patients as defined by an increase in luminal diameter of Z 50% ( P <0.05). Success is comparable with images seen in Figures 2 and 3. Dyspnea indices improved after stenting compared with baseline values with an average improvement of 2.9 at 7 days and 3.2 at 30 days ( P <0.05). Improvement at 90 days was not clinically significant ( P Z 0.05) (Table 2). Physician satisfaction with the deployment of the stent was high. Six aspects of the deployment system, including guidewire passage through the catheter, catheter passage into airway, stent release, catheter removal from airway, visualization, and accuracy of stent placement were rated on a 4-point scale where 4 = excellent and 1 = poor. A final average score between ''good'' (3) and ''excellent'' (4) was reported for each aspect with an overall average of 3.57. The stent was determined to be easily deployed.\nThe major complication of stent placement in this study was migration, which occurred in 28% of patients. Other minor stent-related complications included minimal granulation tissue in 5% (n = 3) and infection in 4% (n =2). Complications not related to the stent placement included pain in 7% (n=4) and hemoptysis in 4% (n =2). Tumor in-growth was not observed in this study.\nSurvival after stent placement was 54 (96%) at 7, 46 (82%) at 30 and 38 (68%) at 90 days. Seven patients had their stent removed for the following reasons: response to concomitant therapy resulting in tumor response (n = 2), granulation tissue formation (n = 3), tumor growth at the ends of the stent requiring further stent placement (n =1), and secretion build-up (n = 1).\n\n## ISCUSSION\n\nThis is the first prospective, multicenter evaluation of a new hybrid completely covered metallic framed\n\n## able 1.

The self-expanding hybrid stent provided immediate palliation in nearly all patients with a reasonable complication rate. It provides some of the strengths of both the silicone and metallic stents while eliminating some of the weaknesses. The self-expanding hybrid stent could be placed in the bronchoscopy laboratory under conscious sedation (a strength of selfexpanding metallic stents 4 ) but could be easily removed when needed (a strength of the silicone stent 4 ). The rate of immediate palliation is consistent with other studies in which metallic stents have been used. 5 Early complication rates are also consistent with published literature. In a study of 82 patients with benign and malignant disease, 54.8% of patients required additional procedures to control granulation tissue formation and disease recurrence (tumor in-growth) postimplant. 6 Another study which included 27 patients had an overall complication rate of 50%. Secretion retention in 18% of the patients required additional interventional procedures and 15% of the patients' experienced recurrent dyspnea from granulation tissue formation at the end of the stent. 7 In this study, we observed 3 instances of slight granulation tissue formation which did not require ablation, no instance of tumor in-growth and no occlusion by secretions, though larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. The rate of migration is higher than what one would see with metallic stents yet, within range of what is found with silicone stents. 5 Since the completion of this trial the stent has been modified and struts have been added to reduce the rate of migration. We have reasons to believe that this goal can be accomplished.\nThis study has several strengths. First, it was a prospective multicentered study that is rare for a trial, which evaluates airway stent technology. Second, many important clinical end points were captured. Improvement in luminal patency was blindly assessed. Dyspnea, a surrogate of quality of life, as assessed by the BDI/TDI, was evaluated prestent and poststent placement and complications were recorded out to 90 days. The study has some weaknesses, namely, that long-term follow-up beyond 90 days was not assessed. Not surprisingly in this cancer population, a number of patients died before the end of the study, though none were related to stent placement. Transitional dyspnea scores were not available for many of the patients at the 90-day follow-up due to inability to travel, entrance into hospice care, or loss to follow-up. Transitional dyspnea scores were not recorded for some patients at 7 and 30 days due to removal of the\ndevice or expiration. Additional studies are needed with a longer follow-up period to accurately assess this new stent technology.\nIn summary, the initial experience with this new hybrid stent was positive. The device was easy to deploy, effective in palliating symptoms and, when indicated, was easy to remove. The complication rate was comparable with that reported in the literature and repeat procedures were rarely required. Further trials are needed to assess the long-term outcomes of this new hybrid stent. Preferably, a study should be conducted comparing the new modified stent versus other stent types.\n\n## EFERENCES\n\n1. Westaby S, Shepherd MP.

DOI: 10.1378/chest.15-0022\n]\nFlexible bronchoscopy (FB) is a widely used procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of bronchopulmonary disorders because of patient comfort, low rate of complications, and lack of requirement of general anesthesia. 1 Most patients tolerate the procedure well although cough is reported to be an extremely distressing symptom. 2 It is likely that the acceptance of bronchoscopy would be signifi cantly improved with control of cough. A combination of midazolam and hydrocodone has been shown to signifi cantly reduce cough during FB, especially when invasive diagnostic procedures are performed. 3 However, in several centers including ours, due to logistics, sedation is not routinely used during basic diagnostic bronchoscopy; procedures such as BAL, endobronchial biopsy (EBB), and transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) are performed under topical anesthesia.\nLignocaine is the most common local anesthetic used during FB because of its quick onset, short duration of action, and lesser toxicity compared with other agents. 4 Th e use of topical lignocaine during FB has been shown to improve patient's tolerance and satisfaction of\nthe procedure. 5,6 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that nebulized lignocaine can reduce the need for supplemental topical anesthesia, administered as injection through the bronchoscope. 7,8 Th e optimal concentration of lignocaine as topical anesthesia, however, remains speculative, and 1% and 2% concentrations of lignocaine solutions are commonly used. The British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend the use of 1% lignocaine while the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) consensus statement endorses a wide range of lignocaine concentrations (1%-10%) that have been found to be eff ective without advocating any particular value. 9,10\nTh ere is little data on the effi cacy of lower concentrations (1%-2%) of lignocaine. 11 It is important that the superiority of a particular concentration be ascertained, as eff ectiveness of lower concentrations would allow the use of higher volumes with lesser chances of complications. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), we report the effi cacy and safety of 1% vs 2% lignocaine for topical anesthesia in patients undergoing FB.\n\n## etting\n\nTh is was an investigator-initiated, single-center, randomized doubleblind trial conducted in the bronchoscopy suite of this institute between May and November 2014. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee (Ref. No. NK/1473/Res/687), and written informed consent was obtained from all the patients. As a protocol in our bronchoscopy suite, patients undergoing BAL, EBB, and TBLB are not routinely sedated, and bronchoscopy is performed under topical anesthesia. Patients undergoing other procedures such as conventional transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA), endobronchial ultrasonographyguided TBNA, and other interventions are routinely sedated with midazolam and pentazocine.\n\n## atients\n\nPatients were eligible for inclusion into the study if they met all of the following criteria: (1) indication for fl exible bronchoscopy, (2) age group of 12 to 90 years, and (3) hemodynamic stability (defi ned as systolic BP . 100 mm Hg and , 180 mm Hg). Patients with any of the following were excluded: (1) pregnancy, (2) hypoxemia (oxygen saturation [by pulse oximetry] , 92% with F io 2 of 0.3), (3) patients undergoing TBNA and other interventions, and (4) failure to provide informed consent.\n\n## andomization\n\nPatients were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either 1% or 2% lignocaine solution. Th e randomization sequence was computer-generated, and the assignments were placed in sealed opaque envelopes. Both the patient and the bronchoscopist were blinded to the concentration of lignocaine solution used for the procedure.\n\n## tudy Protocol\n\nDemographic profi le including age, sex, height, weight, smoking history, BMI, and the type of procedure performed (airway inspection, BAL, EBB, TBLB) was recorded for all patients. Patients in both the groups were prepared in a similar fashion except for the concentration of lignocaine used. All patients were kept fasting overnight. The patients\nwere nebulized with 2.5 mL of 4% lignocaine (Lox, 42.7 mg/mL; Neon Laboratories Ltd) for 15 min prior to the procedure. Lignocaine spray (10%, Lox, 100 mg/mL; Neon Laboratories Ltd) was sprayed twice (10 mg/puff ) over the oropharynx. Approximately 5 mL of lignocaine gel (2%; Neon Laboratories Ltd), equivalent to 100 mg of lignocaine, was administered in the nasal cavity prior to the introduction of the bronchoscope. Patients thereaft er received 2-mL aliquots of 1% or 2% lignocaine solution (Wocaine; Wockhardt) delivered through the bronchoscope using the ''spray-as-you-go'' technique. Four aliquots of 2 mL of lignocaine were administered: one each at the vocal cord, tracheal carina, and in the right and left main bronchus. Extra lignocaine aliquots were given as a ''rescue'' treatment to suppress cough, at the discretion of the operator. Th e sum of the standard dose (2.5 mL of 4% nebulized lignocaine [106.75 mg] plus 5 mL of 2% lignocaine gel [100 mg] plus two puff s of 10% lignocaine spray [20 mg] plus 8 mL of 1% [85.2 mg] or 2% [170.4 mg] lignocaine) and rescue dose made up the total dose of lignocaine used. Patients were monitored for any adverse eff ects related to lignocaine use (like arrhythmia, involuntary movements, convulsions, anaphylaxis, and bronchospasm). Heart rate, respiratory rate, BP , and oxy gen saturation (by pulse oximetry) were monitored throughout the procedure.\nTh e bronchoscopist was asked to assess the intensity of the patient's cough during FB using a visual analog scale (VAS) immediately aft er the procedure. The VAS for cough was rated on a horizontal line, 100 mm in length anchored by 'No cough' at one end and 'Worst cough' at the other. 12 Once stable, the patients recorded their quantum of cough and pain using the VAS and the faces pain rating scale, respectively. Th e faces pain rating scale consists of six faces with brief word instructions provided with the scale representing increasing intensity of pain on an ordinal scale from 0 to 5. 13\n\n## tudy Outcomes\n\nTh e primary outcome of the study was patient comfort during the procedure measured by the intensity of cough rated on a VAS by both the operator and the patient and the pain assessment by the patient using the faces pain rating scale. The secondary outcomes included total lignocaine dose; changes in respiratory rate, heart rate and BP, and\noxygenation status following the procedure; and adverse reactions related to lignocaine (arrhythmia, involuntary movements, convulsions, anaphylaxis, and bronchospasm).\n\n## tatistical Analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using the commercial statistical package SPSS for MS-Windows, version 22 (IBM Corporation). P , .05\nwas considered as statistically significant. Data are presented in a descriptive fashion as number with percentage or median with interquartile range. x 2 (or the Fisher exact test) was used to analyze categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparing the numerical data. The change in variables before, during, and after the procedure was analyzed with multiple repeated measure analysis of variance.\n\n## esults\n\nDuring the study period, 500 consecutive patients (250 in each group, 70.6% men) with a median (interquartile range) age of 51 years (40-60) were included in the study ( Figure 1 ). Th e baseline characteristics including the demographic characteristics, physiologic parameters, and the type of bronchoscopic procedures performed were similar in the two groups ( Table 1 ). Heart rate, respiratory rate, and BP increased aft er the procedure as compared with baseline in both the study groups. However, the change was not significantly different between the two groups ( Table 2 ).\nTh e median operator VAS score for cough was signifi cantly higher in the 1% group (1% group: 25 vs 2% group: 21; P 5 .015); however, the median patient VAS score for cough was similar between the two groups ( Table 3 ). Th e faces pain rating score was similar in the two groups ( Table 3 ). Th e median total dose of lignocaine used was\nsignifi cantly higher in the 2% group (2% group: 397 mg vs 1% group: 312 mg; P 5 .0001). Similarly, the lignocaine dose adjusted for body weight was also signifi cantly higher in the 2% group ( Table 3 ). Th e number of patients with total administered dose . 8.2 mg/kg lignocaine was also signifi cantly higher in the 2% group ( T able 3 ). Heart rate, respiratory rate, and BP aft er the procedure were similar in the two groups. No adverse events related to lignocaine such as bronchospasm, arrhythmias, involuntary movements, or convulsions were observed in any patient.\n\n## iscussion\n\nTh e result of this large RCT demonstrates that 1% and 2% concentrations of lignocaine solution are equally eff ective in anesthetizing the airway. Th e bronchoscopistreported VAS scores for cough were higher in the 1% lignocaine group; the diff erence although statistically significant is unlikely to be clinically relevant as the\n]\nmedian diff erence of VAS score was merely four points on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. Moreover, the diff erence was not signifi cant in the patients' own assessment of their cough in the two groups. Th e pain rating was also not diff erent in the two groups. Th e cumulative dose in the 1% arm was signifi cantly lower compared with the other group. Thus, 1% lignocaine could achieve topical anesthesia during bronchoscopy as eff ectively as 2% but at a much lower dose compared with 2% lignocaine.\nMost guidelines currently recommend performance of FB under IV sedation. 9,10 However, in our center, due to high patient load and lower doctor-to-patient ratio, basic diagnostic procedures such as BAL, EBB, and TBLB are performed under topical anesthesia without any IV sedation. Although sedation should be used wherever possible, 3,14 local anesthesia can be achieved within 2 min of endotracheal lignocaine application, which blunts the cough refl ex eff ectively, 15 allowing for safe and comfortable performance of FB. 16\nAll values are expressed as median with interquartile range, unless otherwise stated.\nAll values are mean (SD) unless otherwise stated. P , .05 was taken as signifi cant. The diff erences between the means was analyzed using multiple repeated measure analysis of variance with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons; the within-groups factor was time (baseline, during, and after), and the between-groups factor was the lignocaine groups (1% vs 2%). FB 5 fl exible bronchoscopy.\nFew studies have evaluated the effective lignocaine concentration for topical anesthesia during FB ( T able 4 ). 11,17-19 Of the four, one has been published only as an abstract while three are peer reviewed. 19 Of the three peer-reviewed studies, only a single study was performed in the bronchoscopy suite, while the other two studies were conducted in the operating suite and are, thus, diff erent from the routine practice in the bronchoscopy suite. Th e results of these studies suggest that 2% is as effi cacious as 4% solution while 1% is as eff ective at 2% lignocaine. Th e limitation of these studies apart from diff ering methodologies is the small sample size. Th e results of our study supplement these studies and confi rm that 1% lignocaine solution is as efficacious as 2% but has the added advantage of effectiveness at signifi cantly lower cumulative dose.\nTh ese fi ndings are important for routine practice as there are reported cases of death from presumed lignocaine toxicity after FB. 20,21 In fact, 28% of patients in the 2% lignocaine arm of our study exceeded the dose of . 8.2 mg/kg, recommended as the maximum dose by the British Th oracic Society. 22 In another study, the anesthetists used doses of up to 14.8 mg/kg lignocaine by a spray-as-you-go method in a study involving volunteer subjects undergoing awake fi ber-optic intubation; some volunteers were reported to have experienced involuntary movements, symptoms that may precede convulsions, which is a sign of lignocaine toxicity. 23 Th e pharmacokinetics of topical lignocaine during FB are complex and can be influenced by several factors, including the duration and frequency of suctioning. 24 This means that the plasma levels\nAll values in median (interquartile range), unless mentioned. VAS 5 visual analog scale.\nRCT 5 randomized controlled trial. See Table 2 and 3 legends for expansion of other abbreviations.\n]\nachieved in an individual patient are often unpredictable. 25-29 However, the propensity would increase with increasing doses of lignocaine used. By using 1% lignocaine, the risk of potential toxicity would be lower although it is still essential to carefully monitor the amount of lignocaine administered during FB. Another important benefit of a lower concentration would be the usage in patients with renal and hepatic dysfunction, as well as in patients with airway infl ammation and pediatric age group, as the dose would be minimized.\nFinally, our study is not without limitations. Th ere were several factors in our study that could aff ect the outcomes. Th ese were multiple operators (consultants, fellows), variable duration of bronchoscopy, wide range of indications, and concomitant procedures. However,\nthey were equally distributed between the two groups. Th e other limitation could be the lack of widespread generalization of our results given the fact that IV sedation was not used while a vast majority of bronchoscopists use sedation. However, lack of sedation can also be regarded as a major strength of the study as it allowed a clear assessment of the cough severity by the patient in contrast to the previous study where the patients were sedated. 11 Th e other obvious strength of the study is the large sample size.\nIn conclusion, the results of this study suggest that 1% lignocaine is similar in effi cacy to 2% lignocaine for topical anesthesia during FB, at signifi cantly lower doses of lignocaine. Hence, 1% lignocaine should be the preferred concentration for topical anesthesia of the larynx and the tracheobronchial tree during FB.\n\n## cknowledgments\n\nAuthor contributions: R.

Th is randomized controlled trial compared the effi cacy and safety of 1% and 2% lignocaine solution for topical anesthesia during FB.\nMETHODS: Consecutive patients were randomized to receive either 1% or 2% lignocaine solution through the bronchoscope by the 'spray-as-you-go' technique. Th e primary outcome of the study was the assessment of cough by the operator and the patient using the visual analog scale (VAS) and pain assessment using the faces pain rating scale. Th e secondary outcomes included total lignocaine dose, oxygenation status, adverse reactions related to lignocaine, and others.\nRESULTS: Five hundred patients were randomized (median age, 51 years; 71% men) 1:1 to either group. Th e median operator VAS score for cough was signifi cantly higher (25 vs 21, P 5 .015) in the 1% group; however, the patient VAS score was not significantly different (32 vs 27, P 5 .065). Th e pain rating was similar between the two groups. Th e median cumulative dose of lignocaine was signifi cantly higher in the 2% group (397 mg vs 312 mg, P 5 .0001; 7.1 mg/kg vs 5.7 mg/kg, P 5 .0001). About 28% of patients in the 2% group exceeded the maximum recommended dose ( . 8.2 mg/kg) of lignocaine. No adverse event related to lignocaine overdose was seen in either group.\nCONCLUSIONS: One percent lignocaine was found to be as eff ective as 2% solution for topical anesthesia during FB, albeit at a signifi cantly lower dose as the latter.

DOI: 10.1378/chest.15-0022\n]\nFlexible bronchoscopy (FB) is a widely used procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of bronchopulmonary disorders because of patient comfort, low rate of complications, and lack of requirement of general anesthesia. 1 Most patients tolerate the procedure well although cough is reported to be an extremely distressing symptom. 2 It is likely that the acceptance of bronchoscopy would be signifi cantly improved with control of cough. A combination of midazolam and hydrocodone has been shown to signifi cantly reduce cough during FB, especially when invasive diagnostic procedures are performed. 3 However, in several centers including ours, due to logistics, sedation is not routinely used during basic diagnostic bronchoscopy; procedures such as BAL, endobronchial biopsy (EBB), and transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) are performed under topical anesthesia.\nLignocaine is the most common local anesthetic used during FB because of its quick onset, short duration of action, and lesser toxicity compared with other agents. 4 Th e use of topical lignocaine during FB has been shown to improve patient's tolerance and satisfaction of\nthe procedure. 5,6 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that nebulized lignocaine can reduce the need for supplemental topical anesthesia, administered as injection through the bronchoscope. 7,8 Th e optimal concentration of lignocaine as topical anesthesia, however, remains speculative, and 1% and 2% concentrations of lignocaine solutions are commonly used. The British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend the use of 1% lignocaine while the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) consensus statement endorses a wide range of lignocaine concentrations (1%-10%) that have been found to be eff ective without advocating any particular value. 9,10\nTh ere is little data on the effi cacy of lower concentrations (1%-2%) of lignocaine. 11 It is important that the superiority of a particular concentration be ascertained, as eff ectiveness of lower concentrations would allow the use of higher volumes with lesser chances of complications.

The patients\nwere nebulized with 2.5 mL of 4% lignocaine (Lox, 42.7 mg/mL; Neon Laboratories Ltd) for 15 min prior to the procedure. Lignocaine spray (10%, Lox, 100 mg/mL; Neon Laboratories Ltd) was sprayed twice (10 mg/puff ) over the oropharynx. Approximately 5 mL of lignocaine gel (2%; Neon Laboratories Ltd), equivalent to 100 mg of lignocaine, was administered in the nasal cavity prior to the introduction of the bronchoscope. Patients thereaft er received 2-mL aliquots of 1% or 2% lignocaine solution (Wocaine; Wockhardt) delivered through the bronchoscope using the ''spray-as-you-go'' technique. Four aliquots of 2 mL of lignocaine were administered: one each at the vocal cord, tracheal carina, and in the right and left main bronchus. Extra lignocaine aliquots were given as a ''rescue'' treatment to suppress cough, at the discretion of the operator.

Thus, 1% lignocaine could achieve topical anesthesia during bronchoscopy as eff ectively as 2% but at a much lower dose compared with 2% lignocaine.\nMost guidelines currently recommend performance of FB under IV sedation. 9,10 However, in our center, due to high patient load and lower doctor-to-patient ratio, basic diagnostic procedures such as BAL, EBB, and TBLB are performed under topical anesthesia without any IV sedation. Although sedation should be used wherever possible, 3,14 local anesthesia can be achieved within 2 min of endotracheal lignocaine application, which blunts the cough refl ex eff ectively, 15 allowing for safe and comfortable performance of FB. 16\nAll values are expressed as median with interquartile range, unless otherwise stated.\nAll values are mean (SD) unless otherwise stated. P , .05 was taken as signifi cant. The diff erences between the means was analyzed using multiple repeated measure analysis of variance with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons; the within-groups factor was time (baseline, during, and after), and the between-groups factor was the lignocaine groups (1% vs 2%). FB 5 fl exible bronchoscopy.\nFew studies have evaluated the effective lignocaine concentration for topical anesthesia during FB ( T able 4 ). 11,17-19 Of the four, one has been published only as an abstract while three are peer reviewed. 19 Of the three peer-reviewed studies, only a single study was performed in the bronchoscopy suite, while the other two studies were conducted in the operating suite and are, thus, diff erent from the routine practice in the bronchoscopy suite. Th e results of these studies suggest that 2% is as effi cacious as 4% solution while 1% is as eff ective at 2% lignocaine. Th e limitation of these studies apart from diff ering methodologies is the small sample size. Th e results of our study supplement these studies and confi rm that 1% lignocaine solution is as efficacious as 2% but has the added advantage of effectiveness at signifi cantly lower cumulative dose.\nTh ese fi ndings are important for routine practice as there are reported cases of death from presumed lignocaine toxicity after FB. 20,21 In fact, 28% of patients in the 2% lignocaine arm of our study exceeded the dose of . 8.2 mg/kg, recommended as the maximum dose by the British Th oracic Society. 22 In another study, the anesthetists used doses of up to 14.8 mg/kg lignocaine by a spray-as-you-go method in a study involving volunteer subjects undergoing awake fi ber-optic intubation; some volunteers were reported to have experienced involuntary movements, symptoms that may precede convulsions, which is a sign of lignocaine toxicity. 23 Th e pharmacokinetics of topical lignocaine during FB are complex and can be influenced by several factors, including the duration and frequency of suctioning. 24 This means that the plasma levels\nAll values in median (interquartile range), unless mentioned.

See Table 2 and 3 legends for expansion of other abbreviations.\n]\nachieved in an individual patient are often unpredictable. 25-29 However, the propensity would increase with increasing doses of lignocaine used. By using 1% lignocaine, the risk of potential toxicity would be lower although it is still essential to carefully monitor the amount of lignocaine administered during FB. Another important benefit of a lower concentration would be the usage in patients with renal and hepatic dysfunction, as well as in patients with airway infl ammation and pediatric age group, as the dose would be minimized.\nFinally, our study is not without limitations. Th ere were several factors in our study that could aff ect the outcomes. Th ese were multiple operators (consultants, fellows), variable duration of bronchoscopy, wide range of indications, and concomitant procedures. However,\nthey were equally distributed between the two groups. Th e other limitation could be the lack of widespread generalization of our results given the fact that IV sedation was not used while a vast majority of bronchoscopists use sedation. However, lack of sedation can also be regarded as a major strength of the study as it allowed a clear assessment of the cough severity by the patient in contrast to the previous study where the patients were sedated. 11 Th e other obvious strength of the study is the large sample size.\nIn conclusion, the results of this study suggest that 1% lignocaine is similar in effi cacy to 2% lignocaine for topical anesthesia during FB, at signifi cantly lower doses of lignocaine. Hence, 1% lignocaine should be the preferred concentration for topical anesthesia of the larynx and the tracheobronchial tree during FB.", "category": "discussion", "level": null, "page_start": null, "page_end": null, "section_id": null}, {"title": "Acknowledgments", "content": "Author contributions: R.

Th is randomized controlled trial compared the effi cacy and safety of 1% and 2% lignocaine solution for topical anesthesia during FB.\nMETHODS: Consecutive patients were randomized to receive either 1% or 2% lignocaine solution through the bronchoscope by the 'spray-as-you-go' technique. Th e primary outcome of the study was the assessment of cough by the operator and the patient using the visual analog scale (VAS) and pain assessment using the faces pain rating scale. Th e secondary outcomes included total lignocaine dose, oxygenation status, adverse reactions related to lignocaine, and others.\nRESULTS: Five hundred patients were randomized (median age, 51 years; 71% men) 1:1 to either group. Th e median operator VAS score for cough was signifi cantly higher (25 vs 21, P 5 .015) in the 1% group; however, the patient VAS score was not significantly different (32 vs 27, P 5 .065). Th e pain rating was similar between the two groups. Th e median cumulative dose of lignocaine was signifi cantly higher in the 2% group (397 mg vs 312 mg, P 5 .0001; 7.1 mg/kg vs 5.7 mg/kg, P 5 .0001). About 28% of patients in the 2% group exceeded the maximum recommended dose ( . 8.2 mg/kg) of lignocaine. No adverse event related to lignocaine overdose was seen in either group.\nCONCLUSIONS: One percent lignocaine was found to be as eff ective as 2% solution for topical anesthesia during FB, albeit at a signifi cantly lower dose as the latter.

DOI: 10.1378/chest.15-0022\n]\nFlexible bronchoscopy (FB) is a widely used procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of bronchopulmonary disorders because of patient comfort, low rate of complications, and lack of requirement of general anesthesia. 1 Most patients tolerate the procedure well although cough is reported to be an extremely distressing symptom. 2 It is likely that the acceptance of bronchoscopy would be signifi cantly improved with control of cough. A combination of midazolam and hydrocodone has been shown to signifi cantly reduce cough during FB, especially when invasive diagnostic procedures are performed. 3 However, in several centers including ours, due to logistics, sedation is not routinely used during basic diagnostic bronchoscopy; procedures such as BAL, endobronchial biopsy (EBB), and transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) are performed under topical anesthesia.\nLignocaine is the most common local anesthetic used during FB because of its quick onset, short duration of action, and lesser toxicity compared with other agents. 4 Th e use of topical lignocaine during FB has been shown to improve patient's tolerance and satisfaction of\nthe procedure. 5,6 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that nebulized lignocaine can reduce the need for supplemental topical anesthesia, administered as injection through the bronchoscope. 7,8 Th e optimal concentration of lignocaine as topical anesthesia, however, remains speculative, and 1% and 2% concentrations of lignocaine solutions are commonly used. The British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend the use of 1% lignocaine while the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) consensus statement endorses a wide range of lignocaine concentrations (1%-10%) that have been found to be eff ective without advocating any particular value. 9,10\nTh ere is little data on the effi cacy of lower concentrations (1%-2%) of lignocaine. 11 It is important that the superiority of a particular concentration be ascertained, as eff ectiveness of lower concentrations would allow the use of higher volumes with lesser chances of complications. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), we report the effi cacy and safety of 1% vs 2% lignocaine for topical anesthesia in patients undergoing FB.\n\n## etting\n\nTh is was an investigator-initiated, single-center, randomized doubleblind trial conducted in the bronchoscopy suite of this institute between May and November 2014. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee (Ref. No. NK/1473/Res/687), and written informed consent was obtained from all the patients. As a protocol in our bronchoscopy suite, patients undergoing BAL, EBB, and TBLB are not routinely sedated, and bronchoscopy is performed under topical anesthesia. Patients undergoing other procedures such as conventional transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA), endobronchial ultrasonographyguided TBNA, and other interventions are routinely sedated with midazolam and pentazocine.\n\n## atients\n\nPatients were eligible for inclusion into the study if they met all of the following criteria: (1) indication for fl exible bronchoscopy, (2) age group of 12 to 90 years, and (3) hemodynamic stability (defi ned as systolic BP . 100 mm Hg and , 180 mm Hg). Patients with any of the following were excluded: (1) pregnancy, (2) hypoxemia (oxygen saturation [by pulse oximetry] , 92% with F io 2 of 0.3), (3) patients undergoing TBNA and other interventions, and (4) failure to provide informed consent.\n\n## andomization\n\nPatients were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either 1% or 2% lignocaine solution. Th e randomization sequence was computer-generated, and the assignments were placed in sealed opaque envelopes. Both the patient and the bronchoscopist were blinded to the concentration of lignocaine solution used for the procedure.\n\n## tudy Protocol\n\nDemographic profi le including age, sex, height, weight, smoking history, BMI, and the type of procedure performed (airway inspection, BAL, EBB, TBLB) was recorded for all patients. Patients in both the groups were prepared in a similar fashion except for the concentration of lignocaine used. All patients were kept fasting overnight. The patients\nwere nebulized with 2.5 mL of 4% lignocaine (Lox, 42.7 mg/mL; Neon Laboratories Ltd) for 15 min prior to the procedure. Lignocaine spray (10%, Lox, 100 mg/mL; Neon Laboratories Ltd) was sprayed twice (10 mg/puff ) over the oropharynx. Approximately 5 mL of lignocaine gel (2%; Neon Laboratories Ltd), equivalent to 100 mg of lignocaine, was administered in the nasal cavity prior to the introduction of the bronchoscope. Patients thereaft er received 2-mL aliquots of 1% or 2% lignocaine solution (Wocaine; Wockhardt) delivered through the bronchoscope using the ''spray-as-you-go'' technique. Four aliquots of 2 mL of lignocaine were administered: one each at the vocal cord, tracheal carina, and in the right and left main bronchus. Extra lignocaine aliquots were given as a ''rescue'' treatment to suppress cough, at the discretion of the operator. Th e sum of the standard dose (2.5 mL of 4% nebulized lignocaine [106.75 mg] plus 5 mL of 2% lignocaine gel [100 mg] plus two puff s of 10% lignocaine spray [20 mg] plus 8 mL of 1% [85.2 mg] or 2% [170.4 mg] lignocaine) and rescue dose made up the total dose of lignocaine used. Patients were monitored for any adverse eff ects related to lignocaine use (like arrhythmia, involuntary movements, convulsions, anaphylaxis, and bronchospasm). Heart rate, respiratory rate, BP , and oxy gen saturation (by pulse oximetry) were monitored throughout the procedure.\nTh e bronchoscopist was asked to assess the intensity of the patient's cough during FB using a visual analog scale (VAS) immediately aft er the procedure. The VAS for cough was rated on a horizontal line, 100 mm in length anchored by 'No cough' at one end and 'Worst cough' at the other. 12 Once stable, the patients recorded their quantum of cough and pain using the VAS and the faces pain rating scale, respectively. Th e faces pain rating scale consists of six faces with brief word instructions provided with the scale representing increasing intensity of pain on an ordinal scale from 0 to 5. 13\n\n## tudy Outcomes\n\nTh e primary outcome of the study was patient comfort during the procedure measured by the intensity of cough rated on a VAS by both the operator and the patient and the pain assessment by the patient using the faces pain rating scale. The secondary outcomes included total lignocaine dose; changes in respiratory rate, heart rate and BP, and\noxygenation status following the procedure; and adverse reactions related to lignocaine (arrhythmia, involuntary movements, convulsions, anaphylaxis, and bronchospasm).\n\n## tatistical Analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using the commercial statistical package SPSS for MS-Windows, version 22 (IBM Corporation). P , .05\nwas considered as statistically significant. Data are presented in a descriptive fashion as number with percentage or median with interquartile range. x 2 (or the Fisher exact test) was used to analyze categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparing the numerical data. The change in variables before, during, and after the procedure was analyzed with multiple repeated measure analysis of variance.\n\n## esults\n\nDuring the study period, 500 consecutive patients (250 in each group, 70.6% men) with a median (interquartile range) age of 51 years (40-60) were included in the study ( Figure 1 ). Th e baseline characteristics including the demographic characteristics, physiologic parameters, and the type of bronchoscopic procedures performed were similar in the two groups ( Table 1 ). Heart rate, respiratory rate, and BP increased aft er the procedure as compared with baseline in both the study groups. However, the change was not significantly different between the two groups ( Table 2 ).\nTh e median operator VAS score for cough was signifi cantly higher in the 1% group (1% group: 25 vs 2% group: 21; P 5 .015); however, the median patient VAS score for cough was similar between the two groups ( Table 3 ). Th e faces pain rating score was similar in the two groups ( Table 3 ). Th e median total dose of lignocaine used was\nsignifi cantly higher in the 2% group (2% group: 397 mg vs 1% group: 312 mg; P 5 .0001). Similarly, the lignocaine dose adjusted for body weight was also signifi cantly higher in the 2% group ( Table 3 ). Th e number of patients with total administered dose . 8.2 mg/kg lignocaine was also signifi cantly higher in the 2% group ( T able 3 ). Heart rate, respiratory rate, and BP aft er the procedure were similar in the two groups. No adverse events related to lignocaine such as bronchospasm, arrhythmias, involuntary movements, or convulsions were observed in any patient.\n\n## iscussion\n\nTh e result of this large RCT demonstrates that 1% and 2% concentrations of lignocaine solution are equally eff ective in anesthetizing the airway. Th e bronchoscopistreported VAS scores for cough were higher in the 1% lignocaine group; the diff erence although statistically significant is unlikely to be clinically relevant as the\n]\nmedian diff erence of VAS score was merely four points on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. Moreover, the diff erence was not signifi cant in the patients' own assessment of their cough in the two groups. Th e pain rating was also not diff erent in the two groups. Th e cumulative dose in the 1% arm was signifi cantly lower compared with the other group. Thus, 1% lignocaine could achieve topical anesthesia during bronchoscopy as eff ectively as 2% but at a much lower dose compared with 2% lignocaine.\nMost guidelines currently recommend performance of FB under IV sedation. 9,10 However, in our center, due to high patient load and lower doctor-to-patient ratio, basic diagnostic procedures such as BAL, EBB, and TBLB are performed under topical anesthesia without any IV sedation. Although sedation should be used wherever possible, 3,14 local anesthesia can be achieved within 2 min of endotracheal lignocaine application, which blunts the cough refl ex eff ectively, 15 allowing for safe and comfortable performance of FB. 16\nAll values are expressed as median with interquartile range, unless otherwise stated.\nAll values are mean (SD) unless otherwise stated. P , .05 was taken as signifi cant. The diff erences between the means was analyzed using multiple repeated measure analysis of variance with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons; the within-groups factor was time (baseline, during, and after), and the between-groups factor was the lignocaine groups (1% vs 2%). FB 5 fl exible bronchoscopy.\nFew studies have evaluated the effective lignocaine concentration for topical anesthesia during FB ( T able 4 ). 11,17-19 Of the four, one has been published only as an abstract while three are peer reviewed. 19 Of the three peer-reviewed studies, only a single study was performed in the bronchoscopy suite, while the other two studies were conducted in the operating suite and are, thus, diff erent from the routine practice in the bronchoscopy suite. Th e results of these studies suggest that 2% is as effi cacious as 4% solution while 1% is as eff ective at 2% lignocaine. Th e limitation of these studies apart from diff ering methodologies is the small sample size. Th e results of our study supplement these studies and confi rm that 1% lignocaine solution is as efficacious as 2% but has the added advantage of effectiveness at signifi cantly lower cumulative dose.\nTh ese fi ndings are important for routine practice as there are reported cases of death from presumed lignocaine toxicity after FB. 20,21 In fact, 28% of patients in the 2% lignocaine arm of our study exceeded the dose of . 8.2 mg/kg, recommended as the maximum dose by the British Th oracic Society. 22 In another study, the anesthetists used doses of up to 14.8 mg/kg lignocaine by a spray-as-you-go method in a study involving volunteer subjects undergoing awake fi ber-optic intubation; some volunteers were reported to have experienced involuntary movements, symptoms that may precede convulsions, which is a sign of lignocaine toxicity. 23 Th e pharmacokinetics of topical lignocaine during FB are complex and can be influenced by several factors, including the duration and frequency of suctioning. 24 This means that the plasma levels\nAll values in median (interquartile range), unless mentioned. VAS 5 visual analog scale.\nRCT 5 randomized controlled trial. See Table 2 and 3 legends for expansion of other abbreviations.\n]\nachieved in an individual patient are often unpredictable. 25-29 However, the propensity would increase with increasing doses of lignocaine used. By using 1% lignocaine, the risk of potential toxicity would be lower although it is still essential to carefully monitor the amount of lignocaine administered during FB. Another important benefit of a lower concentration would be the usage in patients with renal and hepatic dysfunction, as well as in patients with airway infl ammation and pediatric age group, as the dose would be minimized.\nFinally, our study is not without limitations. Th ere were several factors in our study that could aff ect the outcomes. Th ese were multiple operators (consultants, fellows), variable duration of bronchoscopy, wide range of indications, and concomitant procedures. However,\nthey were equally distributed between the two groups. Th e other limitation could be the lack of widespread generalization of our results given the fact that IV sedation was not used while a vast majority of bronchoscopists use sedation. However, lack of sedation can also be regarded as a major strength of the study as it allowed a clear assessment of the cough severity by the patient in contrast to the previous study where the patients were sedated. 11 Th e other obvious strength of the study is the large sample size.\nIn conclusion, the results of this study suggest that 1% lignocaine is similar in effi cacy to 2% lignocaine for topical anesthesia during FB, at signifi cantly lower doses of lignocaine. Hence, 1% lignocaine should be the preferred concentration for topical anesthesia of the larynx and the tracheobronchial tree during FB.\n\n## cknowledgments\n\nAuthor contributions: R.

Speci fi cally, PC drainage was associated with a signi fi cantly lower complication rate following spontaneous pneumothorax than LBCT drainage (Peto odds ratio: 0.49 [95% CI, 0.28 to 0.85]; I 2 1⁄4 29%). In the spontaneous subgroup, PC drainage was associated with a signi fi -cantly shorter drainage duration (mean difference, /C0 1.51 [95% CI, /C0 2.93 to /C0 0.09]) and hospital stay (mean difference: /C0 2.54 [95% CI, /C0 3.16 to /C0 1.92]; P < .001) than the LBCT group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Collectively, results of the meta-analysis suggest PC drainage may be considered as the initial treatment option for patients with primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Ideally, randomized controlled trials are needed to compare PC vs LBCT among different subgroups of patients with pneumothorax, which may ultimately improve clinical care and management for these patients.\nTRIAL REGISTRY: PROSPERO; No.: CRD42017078481; URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/ prospero/.

Pneumothorax can be categorized according to its etiology as primary spontaneous pneumothorax, secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, and iatrogenic or traumatic pneumothorax. Although a small spontaneous pneumothorax may resolve without treatment, for patients who are symptomatic (ie, signi fi cant dyspnea de fi ned as deterioration in usual exercise tolerance 2 ) and exhibit a larger pneumothorax (rim of air > 2 cm), simple aspiration or tube thoracostomy is necessary. 1 However, whether a smallbore pigtail catheter (PC) or a large-bore chest tube (LBCT) should be used as the initial treatment for pneumothorax remains controversial. For example, according to the American College of Chest Physicians\nDelphi consensus statement, 2 an LBCT (16F-28F) should be used for treating larger and unstable primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax; by contrast, the British Thoracic Society no longer recommends the use of the LBCT for primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. 1 In addition, clinical guidelines are unclear regarding the management strategies for pneumothorax subtypes other than primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Due to the inconsistency and the paucity of evidence, substantial variations exist in the approaches used for the initial management of pneumothorax in clinical practice. 3 We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effectiveness of small-bore PC drainage compared with that of LBCT drainage as the initial treatment for different subtypes of pneumothorax.\n\n## aterials and Methods\n\nThe study protocol was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. 4 This research was exempted from institutional review board approval because it used only existing, publicly available data. The protocol of the present systematic review was registered online with PROSPERO, the international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42017078481).\n\n## earch Strategy and Selection Criteria\n\nWe systematically searched PubMed and Embase for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies published up to October 9, 2017. Natural language terminology, Embase Subject Headings (Emtree) and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) (pneumothorax, pneumothoraces, thoracentesis, drainage catheter, pigtail catheter, chest tube, and thoracostomy) with Boolean algebra were used to identify articles comparing PC drainage with chest tube drainage in the databases of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. The search was not limited to articles published in English.\nThe abstracts and full text of articles were screened for pertinent information. The inclusion criteria were de fi ned a priori and were as follows: (1) RCTs or cohort studies (prospective or retrospective); (2) articles that reported outcomes (success rates, recurrence rates, complication rates, hospital stay, or prognosis) of primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (or both), traumatic pneumothorax, or iatrogenic pneumothorax; and (3) articles that compared PC drainage vs LBCT drainage for the initial treatment of pneumothorax. We excluded studies on the newborn population and studies if they reported the outcomes for PC drainage or LBCT drainage only.\n\n## ize De fi nitions of PC and Chest Tubes\n\nChest tubes are available in various sizes based on the external diameter, ranging from 6F to 40F. Typically, chest tubes may be straight or coiled at the end ( ' pigtail ' ). A small-bore chest tube is typically # 14F, whereas an LBCT is typically > 14F in diameter. However, in the included studies, only one patient aged 17 years was treated with an LBCT sized 16F and was categorized into the chest tube group. 5\n\n## ata Extraction and Quality Assessment\n\nTwo reviewers (Y. N. K. and S. H. C.) independently extracted the data on the study design, setting, population descriptors, and outcomes. In the case of disagreement, other reviewers (H. Y. C. and Y. H. C.) served as the arbitrators. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the methodologic quality and risk of bias of the included cohort studies, and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used for the included RCTs, as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook. 6,7 The appraisal tools are described in detail in e-Figure 1 and e-Table 1. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool comprises seven methodologic domains: (1) random sequence generation; (2) allocation concealment; (3) blinding of participants and personnel; (4) blinding of assessment; (5) incomplete outcome data; (6) selective reporting; and (7) other sources of bias. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Form comprises eight methodologic domains associated with a risk of bias that are categorized into three groups: (1) representativeness of the exposed cohort; (2) selection of the nonexposed cohort; (3) ascertainment of exposure; (4) demonstration that the outcome of interest was not present at the start of the study; (5) comparability of cohorts on the basis of the design or analysis controlled for confounders; (6) assessment of the outcome; (7) whether the followup was long enough for the outcomes to occur; and (8) and adequacy of follow-up of cohorts (e-Figure 1, e-Table 1).\nTwo reviewers (H. Y. C. and S. H. C.) independently evaluated the quality of the included studies by using the appraisal tools. A highquality study was de fi ned as one that met the criteria for $ 5 domains. In the case of disagreement, a third reviewer (Y. N. K.) served as the arbitrator. Potential publication bias was detected by using Egger ' s test, which was applied to measure the signi fi cance of asymmetry among the included studies. A funnel plot was generated to demonstrate publication bias and effectiveness (log-OR) against the standard error of log-OR (precision).\n\n## tatistical Analysis\n\nThe primary outcomes were success rates and recurrence rates for PC and LBCT drainage performed for all types of pneumothorax. The secondary outcomes were complication rates, drainage duration, and hospital stay for these two types of chest drains. Subgroup analyses were also performed according to regions (United States, Asia, and Egypt), study design (RCTs and cohort studies), and types of\n[ 153#5\nCHEST\nMAY 2018\n]\nspontaneous pneumothorax (primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax).\nThe risk ratio (Relative risk (RR)) and Peto Odds ratio (OR) with 95% CIs were estimated for categorical data and the mean difference (MD) with SD for continuous data. Heterogeneity among studies was quanti fi ed by using I 2 statistics; I 2 > 75%, > 50%, and < 25% were considered\nhigh, moderate, and low heterogeneity, respectively. 8 A random effect model was applied for all analyses. Two-sided P values < .05 were considered statistically signi fi cant. Review Manager version 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014) for Microsoft Windows was used for statistical analysis.\n\n## esults\n\nFigure 1 shows the fl owchart for study selection. We initially identi fi ed 604 citation records. After excluding duplicates (n 1⁄4 115), 489 citation records remained. Thereafter, the titles and abstracts of the 489 citation records were screened, and 457 ineligible studies were excluded. The full text of 32 articles was assessed to determine their eligibility. We excluded 21 citation records, comprising one correspondence, two conference abstracts (due to lack of information on the prespeci fi ed outcomes of interests), 16 non-RCT or cohort studies, one duplicate submission, and another study conducted on the neonatal population. Ultimately, 11 studies were included in the meta-analysis (Table 1). 3,5,9-17\nThe 11 studies involved a total of 875 patients from four continents: one from Africa (Egypt), four from Asia (Taiwan and Hong Kong), one from Europe (Denmark), and fi ve from North America (United States). Of the 11 included studies, two were RCTs 9,10 involving 62 patients, and nine were retrospective cohort studies 3,5,11-17 involving 813 patients. These patients were enrolled from 1973 to 2014. Seven of the included studies involved patients with spontaneous pneumothorax, 3,9,12,14-17 one study involved patients with mixed types of pneumothorax, 5 two studies involved patients with traumatic pneumothorax, 10,11 and one study involved patients with iatrogenic pneumothorax. 13\n\n## able 1 ] Characteristics of Included Studies\n\n(Continued)\n]\n\n## uccess Rates\n\nOverall, in the 11 included studies 3,5,9-17 involving 875 patients, the success rate was similar in the PC (293 of 367 [79.84%]) and LBCT (421 of 508 [82.87%]) groups for all pneumothorax types (Relative risk (RR), 0.99 [95% CI, 0.93 -1.05]; I 2 1⁄4 0%) (Figure 2). Moreover, in subgroups analyses categorized according to pneumothorax types, no signi fi cant differences were observed in the success rate between PC and LBCT. In the traumatic subgroup, the Relative risk (RR) of success rate between the PC and LBCT groups was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.86-1.08), with acceptable heterogeneity ( I 2 1⁄4 35%). In the spontaneous pneumothorax subgroup consisting of seven studies, 3,9,12,14-17 the Relative risk (RR) was 1.06 (95% CI, 0.95-1.18), with low heterogeneity ( I 2 1⁄4 0%). In the iatrogenic pneumothorax subgroup that consisted of only one study, 13 the Relative risk (RR) was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.72-1.31). In the mixed pneumothorax subgroup that consisted of only one study, 5 the Relative risk (RR) was 1.04 (95% CI, 0.76-1.42).\n\n## ecurrence Rates\n\nOnly four studies involving patients with spontaneous pneumothorax reported recurrence rates. 3,12,14,17 The recurrence rate tended to be lower in the PC group (33 of 157 [21.02%]) than in the LBCT group (43 of 143 [30.07%]), although this difference did not reach statistical signi fi cance (Relative risk (RR), 0.78 [95% CI, 0.57-1.09]; I 2 1⁄4 0%) (Figure 3).\n\n## omplication Rates\n\nThe pooled data of nine studies indicated that the PC group (32 of 278 [11.51%]) had a lower complication rate than the LBCT group (72 of 436 [16.51%]; Peto Odds ratio (OR), 0.63 [95% CI, 0. 39-1.03]; I 2 1⁄4 26%) (Figure 4), 3,5,9-12,14,16,17 and this association was mainly driven by spontaneous pneumothorax. Speci fi cally, the PC group had a signi fi cantly lower complication rate following spontaneous pneumothorax than the LBCT group (Peto Odds ratio (OR), 0.49 [95% CI, 0.28-0.85]; P 1⁄4 .01; I 2 1⁄4 29%). 3,9,12,14,16,17 However, in the traumatic subgroup analysis, the complication rate was similar in the PC and LBCT groups (Peto Odds ratio (OR), 1.29 [95% CI, 0.37-4.51]; I 2 1⁄4 0%). 10,11 In the trial 5 with mixed pneumothorax subgroup analysis (spontaneous, iatrogenic, and traumatic pneumothorax), no signi fi cant differences were observed in the complication rate between the groups (Peto Odds ratio (OR), 1.95 [95% CI, 0.35-10.90]).\n\n## rainage Duration\n\nOverall, the PC group had a signi fi cantly shorter drainage duration than the LBCT group (MD, /C0 1.03 [95% CI, /C0 1.84 to /C0 0.23]; P 1⁄4 .01; I 2 1⁄4 51%)\nTable 1\n(Continued)\nNR 1⁄4 no report; PSP 1⁄4 primary spontaneous pneumothorax; SP 1⁄4 spontaneous pneumothorax; SSP 1⁄4 secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. a SP includes PSP and SSP.\n]\n(Figure 5). 3,5,9,11,17 These results were similar across different subtypes of pneumothorax, although the MDs were only signi fi cant for the spontaneous subgroup. In spontaneous subgroup analysis, the PC group exhibited a signi fi cantly shorter drainage duration (MD, /C0 1.51 [95% CI, /C0 2.93 to /C0 0.09]). 3,9,17 In the traumatic subgroup, only one study reported drainage duration, which found no difference in drainage duration between the two groups (MD, /C0 0.40 [95% CI, /C0 0.92 to 0.12]). 11 Moreover, in the mixed pneumothorax subgroup analysis, no signi fi cant differences were observed in drainage duration between the two groups (MD, /C0 1.70 [95% CI, /C0 4.50 to 1.10]). 5\n\n## ospital Stay\n\nThe length of hospital stay was signi fi cantly shorter in the PC group than in the LBCT group (MD, /C0 2.54 [95% CI, /C0 3.16 to /C0 1.92]; P < .001; I 2 1⁄4 0%) (Figure 6), 5,14,16,17 and this association was mainly driven by spontaneous pneumothorax (MD, /C0 2.61 [95% CI, /C0 3.24 to /C0 1.98]; P < .001; I 2 1⁄4 0%). 14,16,17 However, in the mixed pneumothorax subgroup\nanalysis, no difference was observed between both groups (MD, /C0 0.60 [95% CI, /C0 3.90 to 2.70]). 5\n\n## urther Analysis\n\nSubgroup analyses were performed to examine whether the results differ according to the study design (RCT or cohort) and regions (Asia, Egypt, Europe, and United States) (e-Figs 2-8). The results for the success rates, recurrence rates, and complication rates revealed no differences between the PC and LBCT groups regardless of the study design and region (e-Figs 2, 3, 5, and 6). In terms of drainage duration, all subgroup analyses according to the study design (RCT and cohort study) showed that patients who used a PC had a shorter drainage duration than those who used an LBCT (e-Figure 4). The result from the only RCT showed that the PC was associated with a shorter drainage duration than the LBCT (MD, /C0 2.50 [95% CI, /C0 4.00 to /C0 1.00]; P < .001). 9 Moreover, the pooled result of cohort studies revealed that the PC was associated with a shorter drainage duration than the LBCT, with low heterogeneity (MD, /C0 0.52 [95% CI, /C0 0.95 to /C0 0.09];\nχ\nP 1⁄4 .02; I 2 1⁄4 0%). In addition, only one study in Egypt showed that the drainage duration was signi fi cantly shorter in the PC group than in the LBCT group (e-Figure 7). 9 Moreover, studies in Asia, Europe, and the United States found that the PC may require a slightly shorter drainage duration than the LBCT. 3,5,17 In terms of hospital stay, which was only reported in cohort studies, both subgroup analyses according to regions (Asia and United States) showed that patients who used\na PC had a shorter hospital stay than those who used an LBCT (e-Figure 8). 5,14,16,17 Heterogeneities in all aforementioned results were acceptable.\nA subgroup analysis was also conducted according to the spontaneous pneumothorax type (primary, secondary, or mixed) (e-Figs 9-13). No differences were observed in success and recurrence rates between the PC and LBCT groups (e-Figs 9 and 10). However, among secondary\n]\nspontaneous pneumothorax, PC drainage (2 of 80 [2.5%]) had fewer complications than LBCT drainage (8 of 33 [24.24%]) (Peto Odds ratio (OR), 0.13 [95% CI, 0.03 -0.57]; P 1⁄4 .007; I 2 1⁄4 51%) (e-Figure 10). 9,17 We also found that the PC group had a shorter drainage duration than the LBCT group, particularly in the secondary spontaneous pneumothorax subgroup (MD, /C0 2.38 [95% CI, /C0 3.69 to /C0 1.07]; P < .001; I 2 1⁄4 0%) (e-Figure 12). In primary spontaneous pneumothorax and mixed subgroup analyses according to hospital stay, the PC group had a shorter hospital stay than the LBCT group (MD, /C0 2.54 [95% CI, /C0 3.16 to /C0 1.92]; P < .001; I 2 1⁄4 0%) (e-Figure 13).\n\n## ublication Bias Detection\n\nFinally, based on the asymmetry of the funnel plot for insertion success, no signi fi cant unbalance was found in this meta-analysis (Figure 7). According to Duval and Tweedie ' s trim and fi ll analysis, the adjusted result was similar to the original result; the adjusted value was 0.971 (95% CI, 0.917 to 1.027) with Q 1⁄4 10.135, and the original estimated value was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.933 to 1.051) with Q 1⁄4 6.334. The Egger ' s regression intercept indicated no evidence of any asymmetry for the association of tubes with insertion success ( t 1⁄4 1.834 [95% CI, /C0 0.176 to 1.687]). This result suggested that there was no signi fi cant publication bias in our metaanalysis. However, publication bias might be undetected given the small number of included studies.\n\n## iscussion\n\nOur meta-analysis revealed that PC drainage was as effective as LBCT drainage. Furthermore, compared\nwith the LBCT group, the PC group had shorter drainage duration and hospital stay in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax and fewer complications in patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax.\nAlthough the LBCT has been the dominant treatment of choice in pneumothorax patients for decades, in recent years, abundant literature has supported a paradigm shift toward the more routine use of PC for managing pneumothorax with varying severity. The advantages of a PC are smaller size, small incision, better patient comfort, and outpatient management. Some studies have suggested that PC drainage is cost-saving and may be a reasonable treatment approach for the fi rst episode of large spontaneous pneumothorax. 18,19 However, the disadvantage of a PC is the lower fl ow rate. 20,21 The gas fl ow rates through a chest tube are related to various factors, as illustrated in the Fanning equation. 22 Generally, air has minimal viscosity; therefore, a smallbore PC may be suf fi cient for most air leaks resulting from pure alveolar-pleural fi stula regardless of the classi fi cation of pneumothorax. Conversely, the LBCT can be reserved for refractory pneumothorax and in the emergent scenarios. 13\nOverall, the pooled estimate of the RRs for the success rate indicated that PC drainage was as effective as LBCT drainage for the management of pneumothorax irrespective of the subtypes. In previous studies, the success rate of spontaneous pneumothorax has ranged from 65% to 88% for the PC group and 72% to 80% for the LBCT group. 17,19,23 With regard to the recurrence rate, we could only include four studies of spontaneous\n\n## unnel Plot of Standard Error by Log risk ratio\n\npneumothorax, 3,12,14,17 and the pooled results showed no statistically signi fi cant differences between the PC and LBCT groups. A previous study suggested that secondary spontaneous pneumothorax associated with obstructive lung conditions and malignancy (but not infectious diseases) may bene fi t from PC treatment. 24 However, data on the recurrence rate in patients with traumatic or iatrogenic pneumothorax were lacking.\nWe found that the PC group had signi fi cantly lower complication rates than the LBCT group in both spontaneous (six studies) 3,9,12,14,16,17 and secondary (two studies) 9,17 subtypes. The most frequent complications of both groups were tube displacement and sepsis, followed by surgical emphysema. 9,17,25 Hussein et al 9 also found that these complications were more common in the failed cases than in the successful cases, with statistically signi fi cant differences. Moreover, the frequency of drainage complications was higher in the failed cases of the LBCT group than in the failed cases of the PC group. This result suggests that PC drainage may be considered as an initial treatment of choice for patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax given that the complication rate was lower even in the failed cases.\nThe present study reported highly signi fi cant reductions in drainage duration and length of hospital stay among patients with spontaneous pneumothorax who used a PC compared with those who used an LBCT. Speci fi cally, two studies reported a signi fi cantly shorter drainage duration for PC drainage, with low heterogeneity. 9,17 However, the number of included studies was small. Further investigation of drainage duration and hospital stay is warranted.\nThe LBCT has long been the gold standard for most cases of thoracic trauma. In our meta-analysis, we included two articles pertaining to traumatic pneumothorax, which showed no signi fi cant differences in success rates, complication rates, or drainage duration between the PC and LBCT groups. 10,11 However, the two studies were conducted at the same institution. In addition, a few studies have suggested that the PC is preferable in selected patients with uncomplicated pneumothorax without hemothorax or nonemergency tube insertion. 26 In a recent study, Tanizaki et al 27 reported that for patients with chest trauma, drainage ef fi cacy, complication rates, and need for additional invasive procedures did not differ between treatment with 20F to 22F small tubes (even in emergent situations) and LBCT treatment (28F). Nonetheless,\nbecause traumatic pneumothorax often occurs with other organ injuries, and its severity often varies across cases, additional studies are needed to delineate the indications and applications of the PC, taking into account associated complications such as hemopneumothorax, respiratory failure, tracheobronchial injury, tension pneumothorax, and fl ail chest.\nIatrogenic pneumothorax has recently become the most encountered type of pneumothorax compared with traumatic or spontaneous pneumothorax. 28 In most studies, the incidence of pneumothorax secondary to central vein catheter varies between 0.5% and 5%, 29 which ranks highest among the causes of iatrogenic pneumothorax. 30 Only one article included in our study focused on pneumothorax complicated by central vein catheter insertion, 13 and there was no difference in the success rate between the PC and LBCT groups (Relative risk (RR), 0.97 [95% CI, 0.72 -1.31]) (Figure 2). No complications due to PC insertion were observed in this article. The mean PC drainage duration was 1.6 days for PC and 9.8 days for LBCT drainage. Galbois et al 31 included a total of 561 patients (130 patients with iatrogenic pneumothorax and others with spontaneous pneumothorax) who were treated with a PC (8F), and they reported that the rate of video-assisted thoracoscopy due to drainage failure was less frequent for iatrogenic pneumothorax than for primary spontaneous pneumothorax ( P < .001). Although the authors did not compare the effectiveness of PC drainage with that of LBCT drainage, their results suggest that the PC may be used to effectively manage iatrogenic pneumothorax as well.\nThe present meta-analysis has some limitations. First, the fi ve main outcomes were not completely assessed in all articles. Second, only two RCTs were included in our meta-analysis. Retrospective cohort studies have the natural limitation of selection bias and unmeasured confounders; therefore, more RCTs with a suf fi cient sample size should be conducted to con fi rm our results. In the meta-analysis, we analyzed the characteristics of patients obtained from individual studies. Thus, we could not conduct strati fi ed analyses based on patientlevel factors such as age, sex, smoking status, and the initial severity of pneumothorax. Furthermore, our included studies did not comprise patients with pneumothorax requiring mechanical ventilation, which is a group of patients in which further investigation and veri fi cation are required. Lastly, there were no studies comparing PC vs LBCT in patients with pneumothorax who were mechanically ventilated. Because patients with\n[ 153#5\nCHEST\nMAY 2018\n]\nmechanical ventilation have high risks of mortality 32 (ranging from 46% to 77% 33,34 ), tube thoracostomy is routinely used as clinical management. Although a few studies found that the PC sized 7F to 10F can be an effective therapeutic option, 35 with a success rate of 68.6% and no major complications, 36 studies comparing the effectiveness of PC vs LBCT are lacking. Furthermore, the ef fi cacy of PC drainage vs LBCT for barotraumatic pneumothorax remains unclear.\n\n## onclusions\n\nToour knowledge, this study is the fi rst meta-analysis and systematic review comparing PC and LBCT drainage as the initial management strategy for the fi rst episode of pneumothorax. We found that for spontaneous pneumothorax, the drainage duration and hospital stay\nare shorter in the PC group. Furthermore, for secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, the complication rate is signi fi cantly lower in the PC group. Collectively, results of the meta-analysis suggest that the PC drainage may be considered as the initial treatment option for patients with primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Given the paucity of data on utility of PC vs LBCT in patents of traumatic and iatrogenic pneumothorax, as well as the lack of data in this meta-analysis for patients who are being mechanically ventilated, the fi ndings should be interpreted cautiously. Additional studies, ideally multicenter RCTs, are needed to examine the comparative utility of small-bore vs LBCT among different subgroups of patients with pneumothorax, which may ultimately improve clinical care and management for these patients.\n\n## cknowledgments\n\nAuthor contributions: H.

This systemic review and meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of small-bore pigtail catheter (PC) drainage compared with that of large-bore chest tube (LBCT) drainage as the initial treatment approach for all subtypes of pneumothorax.\nMETHODS: PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for observational studies and randomized controlled trials published up to October 9, 2017, that compared PC and LBCT as the initial treatment for pneumothorax. The investigative outcomes included success rates, recurrence rates, complication rates, drainage duration, and hospital stay.\nRESULTS: Of the 11 included studies (875 patients), the success rate was similar in the PC (79.84%) and LBCT (82.87%) groups, with a risk ratio of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.93 to 1.05; I 2 1⁄4 0%). Speci fi cally, PC drainage was associated with a signi fi cantly lower complication rate following spontaneous pneumothorax than LBCT drainage (Peto odds ratio: 0.49 [95% CI, 0.28 to 0.85]; I 2 1⁄4 29%). In the spontaneous subgroup, PC drainage was associated with a signi fi -cantly shorter drainage duration (mean difference, /C0 1.51 [95% CI, /C0 2.93 to /C0 0.09]) and hospital stay (mean difference: /C0 2.54 [95% CI, /C0 3.16 to /C0 1.92]; P < .001) than the LBCT group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Collectively, results of the meta-analysis suggest PC drainage may be considered as the initial treatment option for patients with primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Ideally, randomized controlled trials are needed to compare PC vs LBCT among different subgroups of patients with pneumothorax, which may ultimately improve clinical care and management for these patients.\nTRIAL REGISTRY: PROSPERO; No.: CRD42017078481; URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/ prospero/.

Pneumothorax can be categorized according to its etiology as primary spontaneous pneumothorax, secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, and iatrogenic or traumatic pneumothorax. Although a small spontaneous pneumothorax may resolve without treatment, for patients who are symptomatic (ie, signi fi cant dyspnea de fi ned as deterioration in usual exercise tolerance 2 ) and exhibit a larger pneumothorax (rim of air > 2 cm), simple aspiration or tube thoracostomy is necessary. 1 However, whether a smallbore pigtail catheter (PC) or a large-bore chest tube (LBCT) should be used as the initial treatment for pneumothorax remains controversial. For example, according to the American College of Chest Physicians\nDelphi consensus statement, 2 an LBCT (16F-28F) should be used for treating larger and unstable primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax; by contrast, the British Thoracic Society no longer recommends the use of the LBCT for primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. 1 In addition, clinical guidelines are unclear regarding the management strategies for pneumothorax subtypes other than primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Due to the inconsistency and the paucity of evidence, substantial variations exist in the approaches used for the initial management of pneumothorax in clinical practice. 3 We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effectiveness of small-bore PC drainage compared with that of LBCT drainage as the initial treatment for different subtypes of pneumothorax.", "category": "other", "level": null, "page_start": null, "page_end": null, "section_id": null}, {"title": "Materials and Methods", "content": "The study protocol was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. 4 This research was exempted from institutional review board approval because it used only existing, publicly available data.

The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Form comprises eight methodologic domains associated with a risk of bias that are categorized into three groups: (1) representativeness of the exposed cohort; (2) selection of the nonexposed cohort; (3) ascertainment of exposure; (4) demonstration that the outcome of interest was not present at the start of the study; (5) comparability of cohorts on the basis of the design or analysis controlled for confounders; (6) assessment of the outcome; (7) whether the followup was long enough for the outcomes to occur; and (8) and adequacy of follow-up of cohorts (e-Figure 1, e-Table 1).\nTwo reviewers (H.

Furthermore, compared\nwith the LBCT group, the PC group had shorter drainage duration and hospital stay in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax and fewer complications in patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax.\nAlthough the LBCT has been the dominant treatment of choice in pneumothorax patients for decades, in recent years, abundant literature has supported a paradigm shift toward the more routine use of PC for managing pneumothorax with varying severity. The advantages of a PC are smaller size, small incision, better patient comfort, and outpatient management. Some studies have suggested that PC drainage is cost-saving and may be a reasonable treatment approach for the fi rst episode of large spontaneous pneumothorax. 18,19 However, the disadvantage of a PC is the lower fl ow rate. 20,21 The gas fl ow rates through a chest tube are related to various factors, as illustrated in the Fanning equation. 22 Generally, air has minimal viscosity; therefore, a smallbore PC may be suf fi cient for most air leaks resulting from pure alveolar-pleural fi stula regardless of the classi fi cation of pneumothorax. Conversely, the LBCT can be reserved for refractory pneumothorax and in the emergent scenarios. 13\nOverall, the pooled estimate of the RRs for the success rate indicated that PC drainage was as effective as LBCT drainage for the management of pneumothorax irrespective of the subtypes. In previous studies, the success rate of spontaneous pneumothorax has ranged from 65% to 88% for the PC group and 72% to 80% for the LBCT group. 17,19,23 With regard to the recurrence rate, we could only include four studies of spontaneous", "category": "discussion", "level": null, "page_start": null, "page_end": null, "section_id": null}, {"title": "Funnel Plot of Standard Error by Log risk ratio", "content": "pneumothorax, 3,12,14,17 and the pooled results showed no statistically signi fi cant differences between the PC and LBCT groups. A previous study suggested that secondary spontaneous pneumothorax associated with obstructive lung conditions and malignancy (but not infectious diseases) may bene fi t from PC treatment. 24 However, data on the recurrence rate in patients with traumatic or iatrogenic pneumothorax were lacking.\nWe found that the PC group had signi fi cantly lower complication rates than the LBCT group in both spontaneous (six studies) 3,9,12,14,16,17 and secondary (two studies) 9,17 subtypes. The most frequent complications of both groups were tube displacement and sepsis, followed by surgical emphysema. 9,17,25 Hussein et al 9 also found that these complications were more common in the failed cases than in the successful cases, with statistically signi fi cant differences. Moreover, the frequency of drainage complications was higher in the failed cases of the LBCT group than in the failed cases of the PC group. This result suggests that PC drainage may be considered as an initial treatment of choice for patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax given that the complication rate was lower even in the failed cases.\nThe present study reported highly signi fi cant reductions in drainage duration and length of hospital stay among patients with spontaneous pneumothorax who used a PC compared with those who used an LBCT. Speci fi cally, two studies reported a signi fi cantly shorter drainage duration for PC drainage, with low heterogeneity. 9,17 However, the number of included studies was small. Further investigation of drainage duration and hospital stay is warranted.\nThe LBCT has long been the gold standard for most cases of thoracic trauma. In our meta-analysis, we included two articles pertaining to traumatic pneumothorax, which showed no signi fi cant differences in success rates, complication rates, or drainage duration between the PC and LBCT groups. 10,11 However, the two studies were conducted at the same institution. In addition, a few studies have suggested that the PC is preferable in selected patients with uncomplicated pneumothorax without hemothorax or nonemergency tube insertion. 26 In a recent study, Tanizaki et al 27 reported that for patients with chest trauma, drainage ef fi cacy, complication rates, and need for additional invasive procedures did not differ between treatment with 20F to 22F small tubes (even in emergent situations) and LBCT treatment (28F). Nonetheless,\nbecause traumatic pneumothorax often occurs with other organ injuries, and its severity often varies across cases, additional studies are needed to delineate the indications and applications of the PC, taking into account associated complications such as hemopneumothorax, respiratory failure, tracheobronchial injury, tension pneumothorax, and fl ail chest.\nIatrogenic pneumothorax has recently become the most encountered type of pneumothorax compared with traumatic or spontaneous pneumothorax. 28 In most studies, the incidence of pneumothorax secondary to central vein catheter varies between 0.5% and 5%, 29 which ranks highest among the causes of iatrogenic pneumothorax. 30 Only one article included in our study focused on pneumothorax complicated by central vein catheter insertion, 13 and there was no difference in the success rate between the PC and LBCT groups (Relative risk (RR), 0.97 [95% CI, 0.72 -1.31]) (Figure 2). No complications due to PC insertion were observed in this article. The mean PC drainage duration was 1.6 days for PC and 9.8 days for LBCT drainage. Galbois et al 31 included a total of 561 patients (130 patients with iatrogenic pneumothorax and others with spontaneous pneumothorax) who were treated with a PC (8F), and they reported that the rate of video-assisted thoracoscopy due to drainage failure was less frequent for iatrogenic pneumothorax than for primary spontaneous pneumothorax ( P < .001). Although the authors did not compare the effectiveness of PC drainage with that of LBCT drainage, their results suggest that the PC may be used to effectively manage iatrogenic pneumothorax as well.\nThe present meta-analysis has some limitations. First, the fi ve main outcomes were not completely assessed in all articles. Second, only two RCTs were included in our meta-analysis. Retrospective cohort studies have the natural limitation of selection bias and unmeasured confounders; therefore, more RCTs with a suf fi cient sample size should be conducted to con fi rm our results. In the meta-analysis, we analyzed the characteristics of patients obtained from individual studies. Thus, we could not conduct strati fi ed analyses based on patientlevel factors such as age, sex, smoking status, and the initial severity of pneumothorax. Furthermore, our included studies did not comprise patients with pneumothorax requiring mechanical ventilation, which is a group of patients in which further investigation and veri fi cation are required. Lastly, there were no studies comparing PC vs LBCT in patients with pneumothorax who were mechanically ventilated. Because patients with\n[ 153#5\nCHEST\nMAY 2018\n]\nmechanical ventilation have high risks of mortality 32 (ranging from 46% to 77% 33,34 ), tube thoracostomy is routinely used as clinical management. Although a few studies found that the PC sized 7F to 10F can be an effective therapeutic option, 35 with a success rate of 68.6% and no major complications, 36 studies comparing the effectiveness of PC vs LBCT are lacking.

Furthermore, for secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, the complication rate is signi fi cantly lower in the PC group. Collectively, results of the meta-analysis suggest that the PC drainage may be considered as the initial treatment option for patients with primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Given the paucity of data on utility of PC vs LBCT in patents of traumatic and iatrogenic pneumothorax, as well as the lack of data in this meta-analysis for patients who are being mechanically ventilated, the fi ndings should be interpreted cautiously. Additional studies, ideally multicenter RCTs, are needed to examine the comparative utility of small-bore vs LBCT among different subgroups of patients with pneumothorax, which may ultimately improve clinical care and management for these patients.", "category": "conclusion", "level": null, "page_start": null, "page_end": null, "section_id": null}, {"title": "Acknowledgments", "content": "Author contributions: H.

This systemic review and meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of small-bore pigtail catheter (PC) drainage compared with that of large-bore chest tube (LBCT) drainage as the initial treatment approach for all subtypes of pneumothorax.\nMETHODS: PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for observational studies and randomized controlled trials published up to October 9, 2017, that compared PC and LBCT as the initial treatment for pneumothorax. The investigative outcomes included success rates, recurrence rates, complication rates, drainage duration, and hospital stay.\nRESULTS: Of the 11 included studies (875 patients), the success rate was similar in the PC (79.84%) and LBCT (82.87%) groups, with a risk ratio of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.93 to 1.05; I 2 1⁄4 0%). Speci fi cally, PC drainage was associated with a signi fi cantly lower complication rate following spontaneous pneumothorax than LBCT drainage (Peto odds ratio: 0.49 [95% CI, 0.28 to 0.85]; I 2 1⁄4 29%). In the spontaneous subgroup, PC drainage was associated with a signi fi -cantly shorter drainage duration (mean difference, /C0 1.51 [95% CI, /C0 2.93 to /C0 0.09]) and hospital stay (mean difference: /C0 2.54 [95% CI, /C0 3.16 to /C0 1.92]; P < .001) than the LBCT group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Collectively, results of the meta-analysis suggest PC drainage may be considered as the initial treatment option for patients with primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Ideally, randomized controlled trials are needed to compare PC vs LBCT among different subgroups of patients with pneumothorax, which may ultimately improve clinical care and management for these patients.\nTRIAL REGISTRY: PROSPERO; No.: CRD42017078481; URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/ prospero/.

Pneumothorax can be categorized according to its etiology as primary spontaneous pneumothorax, secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, and iatrogenic or traumatic pneumothorax. Although a small spontaneous pneumothorax may resolve without treatment, for patients who are symptomatic (ie, signi fi cant dyspnea de fi ned as deterioration in usual exercise tolerance 2 ) and exhibit a larger pneumothorax (rim of air > 2 cm), simple aspiration or tube thoracostomy is necessary. 1 However, whether a smallbore pigtail catheter (PC) or a large-bore chest tube (LBCT) should be used as the initial treatment for pneumothorax remains controversial. For example, according to the American College of Chest Physicians\nDelphi consensus statement, 2 an LBCT (16F-28F) should be used for treating larger and unstable primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax; by contrast, the British Thoracic Society no longer recommends the use of the LBCT for primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. 1 In addition, clinical guidelines are unclear regarding the management strategies for pneumothorax subtypes other than primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Due to the inconsistency and the paucity of evidence, substantial variations exist in the approaches used for the initial management of pneumothorax in clinical practice. 3 We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effectiveness of small-bore PC drainage compared with that of LBCT drainage as the initial treatment for different subtypes of pneumothorax.\n\n## aterials and Methods\n\nThe study protocol was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. 4 This research was exempted from institutional review board approval because it used only existing, publicly available data. The protocol of the present systematic review was registered online with PROSPERO, the international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42017078481).\n\n## earch Strategy and Selection Criteria\n\nWe systematically searched PubMed and Embase for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies published up to October 9, 2017. Natural language terminology, Embase Subject Headings (Emtree) and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) (pneumothorax, pneumothoraces, thoracentesis, drainage catheter, pigtail catheter, chest tube, and thoracostomy) with Boolean algebra were used to identify articles comparing PC drainage with chest tube drainage in the databases of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. The search was not limited to articles published in English.\nThe abstracts and full text of articles were screened for pertinent information. The inclusion criteria were de fi ned a priori and were as follows: (1) RCTs or cohort studies (prospective or retrospective); (2) articles that reported outcomes (success rates, recurrence rates, complication rates, hospital stay, or prognosis) of primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (or both), traumatic pneumothorax, or iatrogenic pneumothorax; and (3) articles that compared PC drainage vs LBCT drainage for the initial treatment of pneumothorax. We excluded studies on the newborn population and studies if they reported the outcomes for PC drainage or LBCT drainage only.\n\n## ize De fi nitions of PC and Chest Tubes\n\nChest tubes are available in various sizes based on the external diameter, ranging from 6F to 40F. Typically, chest tubes may be straight or coiled at the end ( ' pigtail ' ). A small-bore chest tube is typically # 14F, whereas an LBCT is typically > 14F in diameter. However, in the included studies, only one patient aged 17 years was treated with an LBCT sized 16F and was categorized into the chest tube group. 5\n\n## ata Extraction and Quality Assessment\n\nTwo reviewers (Y. N. K. and S. H. C.) independently extracted the data on the study design, setting, population descriptors, and outcomes. In the case of disagreement, other reviewers (H. Y. C. and Y. H. C.) served as the arbitrators. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the methodologic quality and risk of bias of the included cohort studies, and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used for the included RCTs, as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook. 6,7 The appraisal tools are described in detail in e-Figure 1 and e-Table 1. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool comprises seven methodologic domains: (1) random sequence generation; (2) allocation concealment; (3) blinding of participants and personnel; (4) blinding of assessment; (5) incomplete outcome data; (6) selective reporting; and (7) other sources of bias. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Form comprises eight methodologic domains associated with a risk of bias that are categorized into three groups: (1) representativeness of the exposed cohort; (2) selection of the nonexposed cohort; (3) ascertainment of exposure; (4) demonstration that the outcome of interest was not present at the start of the study; (5) comparability of cohorts on the basis of the design or analysis controlled for confounders; (6) assessment of the outcome; (7) whether the followup was long enough for the outcomes to occur; and (8) and adequacy of follow-up of cohorts (e-Figure 1, e-Table 1).\nTwo reviewers (H. Y. C. and S. H. C.) independently evaluated the quality of the included studies by using the appraisal tools. A highquality study was de fi ned as one that met the criteria for $ 5 domains. In the case of disagreement, a third reviewer (Y. N. K.) served as the arbitrator. Potential publication bias was detected by using Egger ' s test, which was applied to measure the signi fi cance of asymmetry among the included studies. A funnel plot was generated to demonstrate publication bias and effectiveness (log-OR) against the standard error of log-OR (precision).\n\n## tatistical Analysis\n\nThe primary outcomes were success rates and recurrence rates for PC and LBCT drainage performed for all types of pneumothorax. The secondary outcomes were complication rates, drainage duration, and hospital stay for these two types of chest drains. Subgroup analyses were also performed according to regions (United States, Asia, and Egypt), study design (RCTs and cohort studies), and types of\n[ 153#5\nCHEST\nMAY 2018\n]\nspontaneous pneumothorax (primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax).\nThe risk ratio (Relative risk (RR)) and Peto Odds ratio (OR) with 95% CIs were estimated for categorical data and the mean difference (MD) with SD for continuous data. Heterogeneity among studies was quanti fi ed by using I 2 statistics; I 2 > 75%, > 50%, and < 25% were considered\nhigh, moderate, and low heterogeneity, respectively. 8 A random effect model was applied for all analyses. Two-sided P values < .05 were considered statistically signi fi cant. Review Manager version 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014) for Microsoft Windows was used for statistical analysis.\n\n## esults\n\nFigure 1 shows the fl owchart for study selection. We initially identi fi ed 604 citation records. After excluding duplicates (n 1⁄4 115), 489 citation records remained. Thereafter, the titles and abstracts of the 489 citation records were screened, and 457 ineligible studies were excluded. The full text of 32 articles was assessed to determine their eligibility. We excluded 21 citation records, comprising one correspondence, two conference abstracts (due to lack of information on the prespeci fi ed outcomes of interests), 16 non-RCT or cohort studies, one duplicate submission, and another study conducted on the neonatal population. Ultimately, 11 studies were included in the meta-analysis (Table 1). 3,5,9-17\nThe 11 studies involved a total of 875 patients from four continents: one from Africa (Egypt), four from Asia (Taiwan and Hong Kong), one from Europe (Denmark), and fi ve from North America (United States). Of the 11 included studies, two were RCTs 9,10 involving 62 patients, and nine were retrospective cohort studies 3,5,11-17 involving 813 patients. These patients were enrolled from 1973 to 2014. Seven of the included studies involved patients with spontaneous pneumothorax, 3,9,12,14-17 one study involved patients with mixed types of pneumothorax, 5 two studies involved patients with traumatic pneumothorax, 10,11 and one study involved patients with iatrogenic pneumothorax. 13\n\n## able 1 ] Characteristics of Included Studies\n\n(Continued)\n]\n\n## uccess Rates\n\nOverall, in the 11 included studies 3,5,9-17 involving 875 patients, the success rate was similar in the PC (293 of 367 [79.84%]) and LBCT (421 of 508 [82.87%]) groups for all pneumothorax types (Relative risk (RR), 0.99 [95% CI, 0.93 -1.05]; I 2 1⁄4 0%) (Figure 2). Moreover, in subgroups analyses categorized according to pneumothorax types, no signi fi cant differences were observed in the success rate between PC and LBCT. In the traumatic subgroup, the Relative risk (RR) of success rate between the PC and LBCT groups was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.86-1.08), with acceptable heterogeneity ( I 2 1⁄4 35%). In the spontaneous pneumothorax subgroup consisting of seven studies, 3,9,12,14-17 the Relative risk (RR) was 1.06 (95% CI, 0.95-1.18), with low heterogeneity ( I 2 1⁄4 0%). In the iatrogenic pneumothorax subgroup that consisted of only one study, 13 the Relative risk (RR) was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.72-1.31). In the mixed pneumothorax subgroup that consisted of only one study, 5 the Relative risk (RR) was 1.04 (95% CI, 0.76-1.42).\n\n## ecurrence Rates\n\nOnly four studies involving patients with spontaneous pneumothorax reported recurrence rates. 3,12,14,17 The recurrence rate tended to be lower in the PC group (33 of 157 [21.02%]) than in the LBCT group (43 of 143 [30.07%]), although this difference did not reach statistical signi fi cance (Relative risk (RR), 0.78 [95% CI, 0.57-1.09]; I 2 1⁄4 0%) (Figure 3).\n\n## omplication Rates\n\nThe pooled data of nine studies indicated that the PC group (32 of 278 [11.51%]) had a lower complication rate than the LBCT group (72 of 436 [16.51%]; Peto Odds ratio (OR), 0.63 [95% CI, 0. 39-1.03]; I 2 1⁄4 26%) (Figure 4), 3,5,9-12,14,16,17 and this association was mainly driven by spontaneous pneumothorax. Speci fi cally, the PC group had a signi fi cantly lower complication rate following spontaneous pneumothorax than the LBCT group (Peto Odds ratio (OR), 0.49 [95% CI, 0.28-0.85]; P 1⁄4 .01; I 2 1⁄4 29%). 3,9,12,14,16,17 However, in the traumatic subgroup analysis, the complication rate was similar in the PC and LBCT groups (Peto Odds ratio (OR), 1.29 [95% CI, 0.37-4.51]; I 2 1⁄4 0%). 10,11 In the trial 5 with mixed pneumothorax subgroup analysis (spontaneous, iatrogenic, and traumatic pneumothorax), no signi fi cant differences were observed in the complication rate between the groups (Peto Odds ratio (OR), 1.95 [95% CI, 0.35-10.90]).\n\n## rainage Duration\n\nOverall, the PC group had a signi fi cantly shorter drainage duration than the LBCT group (MD, /C0 1.03 [95% CI, /C0 1.84 to /C0 0.23]; P 1⁄4 .01; I 2 1⁄4 51%)\nTable 1\n(Continued)\nNR 1⁄4 no report; PSP 1⁄4 primary spontaneous pneumothorax; SP 1⁄4 spontaneous pneumothorax; SSP 1⁄4 secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. a SP includes PSP and SSP.\n]\n(Figure 5). 3,5,9,11,17 These results were similar across different subtypes of pneumothorax, although the MDs were only signi fi cant for the spontaneous subgroup. In spontaneous subgroup analysis, the PC group exhibited a signi fi cantly shorter drainage duration (MD, /C0 1.51 [95% CI, /C0 2.93 to /C0 0.09]). 3,9,17 In the traumatic subgroup, only one study reported drainage duration, which found no difference in drainage duration between the two groups (MD, /C0 0.40 [95% CI, /C0 0.92 to 0.12]). 11 Moreover, in the mixed pneumothorax subgroup analysis, no signi fi cant differences were observed in drainage duration between the two groups (MD, /C0 1.70 [95% CI, /C0 4.50 to 1.10]). 5\n\n## ospital Stay\n\nThe length of hospital stay was signi fi cantly shorter in the PC group than in the LBCT group (MD, /C0 2.54 [95% CI, /C0 3.16 to /C0 1.92]; P < .001; I 2 1⁄4 0%) (Figure 6), 5,14,16,17 and this association was mainly driven by spontaneous pneumothorax (MD, /C0 2.61 [95% CI, /C0 3.24 to /C0 1.98]; P < .001; I 2 1⁄4 0%). 14,16,17 However, in the mixed pneumothorax subgroup\nanalysis, no difference was observed between both groups (MD, /C0 0.60 [95% CI, /C0 3.90 to 2.70]). 5\n\n## urther Analysis\n\nSubgroup analyses were performed to examine whether the results differ according to the study design (RCT or cohort) and regions (Asia, Egypt, Europe, and United States) (e-Figs 2-8). The results for the success rates, recurrence rates, and complication rates revealed no differences between the PC and LBCT groups regardless of the study design and region (e-Figs 2, 3, 5, and 6). In terms of drainage duration, all subgroup analyses according to the study design (RCT and cohort study) showed that patients who used a PC had a shorter drainage duration than those who used an LBCT (e-Figure 4). The result from the only RCT showed that the PC was associated with a shorter drainage duration than the LBCT (MD, /C0 2.50 [95% CI, /C0 4.00 to /C0 1.00]; P < .001). 9 Moreover, the pooled result of cohort studies revealed that the PC was associated with a shorter drainage duration than the LBCT, with low heterogeneity (MD, /C0 0.52 [95% CI, /C0 0.95 to /C0 0.09];\nχ\nP 1⁄4 .02; I 2 1⁄4 0%). In addition, only one study in Egypt showed that the drainage duration was signi fi cantly shorter in the PC group than in the LBCT group (e-Figure 7). 9 Moreover, studies in Asia, Europe, and the United States found that the PC may require a slightly shorter drainage duration than the LBCT. 3,5,17 In terms of hospital stay, which was only reported in cohort studies, both subgroup analyses according to regions (Asia and United States) showed that patients who used\na PC had a shorter hospital stay than those who used an LBCT (e-Figure 8). 5,14,16,17 Heterogeneities in all aforementioned results were acceptable.\nA subgroup analysis was also conducted according to the spontaneous pneumothorax type (primary, secondary, or mixed) (e-Figs 9-13). No differences were observed in success and recurrence rates between the PC and LBCT groups (e-Figs 9 and 10). However, among secondary\n]\nspontaneous pneumothorax, PC drainage (2 of 80 [2.5%]) had fewer complications than LBCT drainage (8 of 33 [24.24%]) (Peto Odds ratio (OR), 0.13 [95% CI, 0.03 -0.57]; P 1⁄4 .007; I 2 1⁄4 51%) (e-Figure 10). 9,17 We also found that the PC group had a shorter drainage duration than the LBCT group, particularly in the secondary spontaneous pneumothorax subgroup (MD, /C0 2.38 [95% CI, /C0 3.69 to /C0 1.07]; P < .001; I 2 1⁄4 0%) (e-Figure 12). In primary spontaneous pneumothorax and mixed subgroup analyses according to hospital stay, the PC group had a shorter hospital stay than the LBCT group (MD, /C0 2.54 [95% CI, /C0 3.16 to /C0 1.92]; P < .001; I 2 1⁄4 0%) (e-Figure 13).\n\n## ublication Bias Detection\n\nFinally, based on the asymmetry of the funnel plot for insertion success, no signi fi cant unbalance was found in this meta-analysis (Figure 7). According to Duval and Tweedie ' s trim and fi ll analysis, the adjusted result was similar to the original result; the adjusted value was 0.971 (95% CI, 0.917 to 1.027) with Q 1⁄4 10.135, and the original estimated value was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.933 to 1.051) with Q 1⁄4 6.334. The Egger ' s regression intercept indicated no evidence of any asymmetry for the association of tubes with insertion success ( t 1⁄4 1.834 [95% CI, /C0 0.176 to 1.687]). This result suggested that there was no signi fi cant publication bias in our metaanalysis. However, publication bias might be undetected given the small number of included studies.\n\n## iscussion\n\nOur meta-analysis revealed that PC drainage was as effective as LBCT drainage. Furthermore, compared\nwith the LBCT group, the PC group had shorter drainage duration and hospital stay in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax and fewer complications in patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax.\nAlthough the LBCT has been the dominant treatment of choice in pneumothorax patients for decades, in recent years, abundant literature has supported a paradigm shift toward the more routine use of PC for managing pneumothorax with varying severity. The advantages of a PC are smaller size, small incision, better patient comfort, and outpatient management. Some studies have suggested that PC drainage is cost-saving and may be a reasonable treatment approach for the fi rst episode of large spontaneous pneumothorax. 18,19 However, the disadvantage of a PC is the lower fl ow rate. 20,21 The gas fl ow rates through a chest tube are related to various factors, as illustrated in the Fanning equation. 22 Generally, air has minimal viscosity; therefore, a smallbore PC may be suf fi cient for most air leaks resulting from pure alveolar-pleural fi stula regardless of the classi fi cation of pneumothorax. Conversely, the LBCT can be reserved for refractory pneumothorax and in the emergent scenarios. 13\nOverall, the pooled estimate of the RRs for the success rate indicated that PC drainage was as effective as LBCT drainage for the management of pneumothorax irrespective of the subtypes. In previous studies, the success rate of spontaneous pneumothorax has ranged from 65% to 88% for the PC group and 72% to 80% for the LBCT group. 17,19,23 With regard to the recurrence rate, we could only include four studies of spontaneous\n\n## unnel Plot of Standard Error by Log risk ratio\n\npneumothorax, 3,12,14,17 and the pooled results showed no statistically signi fi cant differences between the PC and LBCT groups. A previous study suggested that secondary spontaneous pneumothorax associated with obstructive lung conditions and malignancy (but not infectious diseases) may bene fi t from PC treatment. 24 However, data on the recurrence rate in patients with traumatic or iatrogenic pneumothorax were lacking.\nWe found that the PC group had signi fi cantly lower complication rates than the LBCT group in both spontaneous (six studies) 3,9,12,14,16,17 and secondary (two studies) 9,17 subtypes. The most frequent complications of both groups were tube displacement and sepsis, followed by surgical emphysema. 9,17,25 Hussein et al 9 also found that these complications were more common in the failed cases than in the successful cases, with statistically signi fi cant differences. Moreover, the frequency of drainage complications was higher in the failed cases of the LBCT group than in the failed cases of the PC group. This result suggests that PC drainage may be considered as an initial treatment of choice for patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax given that the complication rate was lower even in the failed cases.\nThe present study reported highly signi fi cant reductions in drainage duration and length of hospital stay among patients with spontaneous pneumothorax who used a PC compared with those who used an LBCT. Speci fi cally, two studies reported a signi fi cantly shorter drainage duration for PC drainage, with low heterogeneity. 9,17 However, the number of included studies was small. Further investigation of drainage duration and hospital stay is warranted.\nThe LBCT has long been the gold standard for most cases of thoracic trauma. In our meta-analysis, we included two articles pertaining to traumatic pneumothorax, which showed no signi fi cant differences in success rates, complication rates, or drainage duration between the PC and LBCT groups. 10,11 However, the two studies were conducted at the same institution. In addition, a few studies have suggested that the PC is preferable in selected patients with uncomplicated pneumothorax without hemothorax or nonemergency tube insertion. 26 In a recent study, Tanizaki et al 27 reported that for patients with chest trauma, drainage ef fi cacy, complication rates, and need for additional invasive procedures did not differ between treatment with 20F to 22F small tubes (even in emergent situations) and LBCT treatment (28F). Nonetheless,\nbecause traumatic pneumothorax often occurs with other organ injuries, and its severity often varies across cases, additional studies are needed to delineate the indications and applications of the PC, taking into account associated complications such as hemopneumothorax, respiratory failure, tracheobronchial injury, tension pneumothorax, and fl ail chest.\nIatrogenic pneumothorax has recently become the most encountered type of pneumothorax compared with traumatic or spontaneous pneumothorax. 28 In most studies, the incidence of pneumothorax secondary to central vein catheter varies between 0.5% and 5%, 29 which ranks highest among the causes of iatrogenic pneumothorax. 30 Only one article included in our study focused on pneumothorax complicated by central vein catheter insertion, 13 and there was no difference in the success rate between the PC and LBCT groups (Relative risk (RR), 0.97 [95% CI, 0.72 -1.31]) (Figure 2). No complications due to PC insertion were observed in this article. The mean PC drainage duration was 1.6 days for PC and 9.8 days for LBCT drainage. Galbois et al 31 included a total of 561 patients (130 patients with iatrogenic pneumothorax and others with spontaneous pneumothorax) who were treated with a PC (8F), and they reported that the rate of video-assisted thoracoscopy due to drainage failure was less frequent for iatrogenic pneumothorax than for primary spontaneous pneumothorax ( P < .001). Although the authors did not compare the effectiveness of PC drainage with that of LBCT drainage, their results suggest that the PC may be used to effectively manage iatrogenic pneumothorax as well.\nThe present meta-analysis has some limitations. First, the fi ve main outcomes were not completely assessed in all articles. Second, only two RCTs were included in our meta-analysis. Retrospective cohort studies have the natural limitation of selection bias and unmeasured confounders; therefore, more RCTs with a suf fi cient sample size should be conducted to con fi rm our results. In the meta-analysis, we analyzed the characteristics of patients obtained from individual studies. Thus, we could not conduct strati fi ed analyses based on patientlevel factors such as age, sex, smoking status, and the initial severity of pneumothorax. Furthermore, our included studies did not comprise patients with pneumothorax requiring mechanical ventilation, which is a group of patients in which further investigation and veri fi cation are required. Lastly, there were no studies comparing PC vs LBCT in patients with pneumothorax who were mechanically ventilated. Because patients with\n[ 153#5\nCHEST\nMAY 2018\n]\nmechanical ventilation have high risks of mortality 32 (ranging from 46% to 77% 33,34 ), tube thoracostomy is routinely used as clinical management. Although a few studies found that the PC sized 7F to 10F can be an effective therapeutic option, 35 with a success rate of 68.6% and no major complications, 36 studies comparing the effectiveness of PC vs LBCT are lacking. Furthermore, the ef fi cacy of PC drainage vs LBCT for barotraumatic pneumothorax remains unclear.\n\n## onclusions\n\nToour knowledge, this study is the fi rst meta-analysis and systematic review comparing PC and LBCT drainage as the initial management strategy for the fi rst episode of pneumothorax. We found that for spontaneous pneumothorax, the drainage duration and hospital stay\nare shorter in the PC group. Furthermore, for secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, the complication rate is signi fi cantly lower in the PC group. Collectively, results of the meta-analysis suggest that the PC drainage may be considered as the initial treatment option for patients with primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Given the paucity of data on utility of PC vs LBCT in patents of traumatic and iatrogenic pneumothorax, as well as the lack of data in this meta-analysis for patients who are being mechanically ventilated, the fi ndings should be interpreted cautiously. Additional studies, ideally multicenter RCTs, are needed to examine the comparative utility of small-bore vs LBCT among different subgroups of patients with pneumothorax, which may ultimately improve clinical care and management for these patients.\n\n## cknowledgments\n\nAuthor contributions: H.
