E-mail: hbgrosu@mdanderson.org\nThis article has an online supplement, which is accessible from this issue's table of contents at www.atsjournals.org\nAnn Am Thorac Soc Vol 12, No 9, pp 1336-1344, Sep 2015 Copyright \u00a9 2015 by the American Thoracic Society DOI: 10.1513/AnnalsATS.201503-165OC Internet address: www.atsjournals.org\nLymphoid neoplasia is diagnosed on the basis of the World Health Organization (WHO) classi fi cation system. The WHO recommends the use of multidimensional diagnostic modalities, including cytomorphologic studies, immunophenotyping, cytogenetic analyses, and molecular studies to accurately subtype lymphoma (1 -4).\nSurgical excision and core biopsy are the current preferred sampling techniques for\ndiagnosing lymphoma, but there is growing interest in using less invasive endoscopic techniques with lower complication rates (5). In patients who present with intrathoracic adenopathy that is suspicious for lymphoma, endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUSTBNA) is an attractive option, given the risks of surgical or core needle sampling (6, 7). In such patients, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA also may\nbe useful for excluding alternative diagnoses, such as sarcoidosis, and may help to identify patients who require more invasive tissue sampling (8, 9).\nThe diagnostic utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in lung cancer diagnosis and staging, including biomarker analysis, has been well established (10, 11). Emerging data suggest that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, along with appropriate immunohistochemical, fl ow cytometric,\ncytogenetic, and molecular studies, can de fi nitively diagnose lymphoma (12, 13). Nonetheless, because disease management often hinges on the pathologic subtype and grade, there is concern that the smaller samples obtained via Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA compared with those obtained by surgical or core needle biopsy may be insuf fi cient to guide treatment decisions. Even in our high-volume dedicated cancer center, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is only used in a minority of patients with suspected lymphoma.\nThere is a paucity of data on whether Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA provides adequate tissue samples for diagnosing and subtyping lymphoma (i.e., no additional biopsies are required for pathologic subtyping and grading). Additionally, sensitivity and speci fi city have been reported in most of the studies on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for lymphoma in the literature; however, sensitivity and speci fi city can have only two possible results: positive or negative. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA typically has more than two meaningful possible results. For diagnostic tests in which there are more than two meaningful results, the use of likelihood ratios is more appropriate, because it re fl ects the information value of each of the categories separately. Therefore, in this study, we determined on the basis of likelihood ratios whether Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA could accurately diagnose and subtype lymphoma in patients with isolated intrathoracic adenopathy that was suspicious for lymphoma.\n\n## ethods\n\nWe performed a retrospective review of all Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA cases from January 2007 to March 2014 at our institution. Institutional review board approval was obtained under protocol number PA14-0320. Patients aged 18 years or older with isolated intrathoracic adenopathy suspected of lymphoma were included. We excluded patients with known history of sarcoidosis, mycobacterial disease, or fungal infections; lung masses suspicious for primary lung cancer; and nonlymphoma malignancies in the previous 5 years that had metastasized to the chest. Patient-level factors, including medical history, were abstracted from the patient charts.\n\n## ronchoscopy Procedure and Specimen Processing\n\nDetails of the bronchoscopy procedure and specimen processing can be\nfound in Appendix E1 in the online supplement.\n\n## e fi nitions\n\nSuspected de novo lymphoma was de fi ned as new isolated intrathoracic lymphadenopathy or a mediastinal mass found on imaging studies in patients with a clinically compatible presentation and no history of lymphoma. Suspected recurrent lymphoma was de fi ned as new intrathoracic adenopathy or a mediastinal mass observed on imaging scans in patients with a clinically compatible presentation and a history of lymphoma. Clinically compatible presentation was determined by the referring physician and included any of the following: B symptoms (fever, night sweats, and/or weight loss), cytopenia, and/or peripheral lymphadenopathy.\nThe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA results were classi fi ed according to the pathologic diagnosis, as follows:\n1. Lymphoma that could be subtyped : Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was diagnostic of lymphoma and subtyping was possible using solely the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA sample; no additional tissue sampling was required.\n2. Lymphoma that could not be subtyped : Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA demonstrated cells that were consistent with lymphoma on the basis of cytomorphologic or immunophenotypic features, but additional tissue sampling was required to subtype the disease.\n3. Speci fi c nonlymphoma diagnosis : EBUSTBNA diagnosed a condition other than lymphoma. For example, the fi nding of acid-fast organisms in addition to granulomas was consistent with mycobacterial disease. The fi nding of other forms of cancer was also considered de fi nitive.\n4. Granulomatous in fl ammation without a speci fi c diagnosis : Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA demonstrated granulomas but no speci fi c diagnosis by direct staining. If granulomas were present and staining identi fi ed a pathogen (e.g., acid-fast organisms) in the same Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA sample, establishing a speci fi c diagnosis (e.g., tuberculosis), it was classi fi ed as a speci fi c nonlymphoma diagnosis rather than as granulomatous in fl ammation without a speci fi c diagnosis.\n5. Adequate lymphocytes but no speci fi c diagnosis : Adequate benign lymphoid tissue was present on at least one EBUSTBNA specimen.\n6. Inadequate lymphocytes but no speci fi c diagnosis : No cytologic evidence of lymph node sampling was present.\nAll patients were assigned a fi nal diagnosis by the treating multidisciplinary hematology oncology and pulmonary team on the basis of a review of their clinical, pathologic, microbiologic, and radiologic data, with follow-up for at least 6 months. The fi nal diagnostic categories were as follows:\n1. De novo lymphoma : Final diagnosis of lymphoma in a patient with no history of lymphoma\n2. Relapsed lymphoma : Final diagnosis of lymphoma in a patient with a history of lymphoma\n3. Other malignant diagnosis : Nonlymphoma malignancy on fi nal diagnosis\n4. Speci fi c infectious disease : Findings established by microbiologic cultures in the appropriate clinical context (e.g., histoplasmosis and tuberculosis)\n5. Sarcoidosis : A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was based on clinicopathologic criteria if granulomas were found, there was a compatible clinical history, and other causes of granulomatous disease had been excluded.\n6. Other nonspeci fi c benign diagnosis : If no speci fi c disease was found on EBUSTBNA or another diagnostic test or biopsy and the patient was observed for a minimum of 6 months with no changes, the condition was classi fi ed as benign.\nThose diagnosed with lymphoma were subclassi fi ed as having Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or low-grade NHL.\n\n## iagnostic Outcomes\n\nWe studied the ability of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA to diagnose lymphoma by asking two distinct questions. The fi rst was how effective EBUSTBNAwas in determining whether a patient had lymphoma. However, identifying that a patient has lymphoma is not always suf fi cient, because the precise subtype of lymphoma dictates treatment. Therefore, the second question was how effective Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was in determining the subtype of lymphoma present so that treatment decisions could be made.\nTo determine whether Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA could diagnose lymphoma, we used likelihood ratios. We considered all patients with a fi nal diagnosis of de novo or relapsed lymphoma to have lymphoma; this served\nas the reference standard of truth. Patients with any other fi nal diagnosis were considered not to have lymphoma. A diagnosis of lymphoma included all lymphomas, even those that could not be\nsubtyped. We used likelihood ratios to determine whether Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA could diagnose lymphoma because they allow the interpretation of diagnostic tests that have more than two possible results.\nDefinition of abbreviations : Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)=endobronchial ultrasound; FDG= fluorodeoxyglucose; NHL = non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nFor the outcome of the ability of EBUSTBNA to diagnose and subtype lymphoma, we calculated sensitivity and speci fi city. For this analysis, all Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA lymphoma results that could be subtyped were classi fi ed as true positives. Those that could not be subtyped were classi fi ed as negative. All other Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA results were also classi fi ed as negative for lymphoma. The reference standard for determining sensitivity and speci fi city was the fi nal diagnosis. The patient had to be observed for a minimum of 6 months for the condition to be classi fi ed as benign on fi nal diagnosis.\n\n## tatistical Methods\n\nThe sensitivity, speci fi city, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were estimated for all patients and for patients in prespeci fi ed subgroups of interest: suspected de novo lymphoma versus relapsed lymphoma, HL, high-grade NHL, and low-grade NHL. We used x 2 tests or Fisher ' s exact test to compare categorical variables and the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test to compare continuous variables.\nLikelihood ratio was de fi ned as the probability of seeing the result in those with the disease divided by the probability of\nseeing the result in those without that disease. As applied to this study, we were interested in likelihood ratio (lymphoma present), likelihood ratio (granulomatous in fl ammation), likelihood ratio (adequate lymphocytes), and likelihood ratio (inadequate lymphocytes). We applied Bayes ' theorem to further re fi ne the diagnostic utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for lymphoma diagnosis. Because the results are not dichotomous, we calculated posttest odds, which in turn were estimated by multiplying the pretest odds by the likelihood ratio. P values less than 0.05 were considered to be signi fi cant. All tests were two-sided. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).\n\n## esults\n\nWe reviewed 4,070 consecutive EBUSTBNA cases from January 2007 to March 2014. One hundred eighty-one patients had suspected lymphoma, 111 (61.3%) had suspected relapse, and 70 (38.7%) had suspected de novo . At fi nal diagnosis, 75 patients (41.5%) had lymphoma.\nOf the 111 patients with suspected relapsed lymphoma, 24 had undergone bone\nmarrow transplantation before EBUSTBNA, 86 had undergone chemotherapy alone, and 25 had undergone chemoradiation therapy. Patients with NHL tended to be older than patients with HL and patients with diagnoses other than lymphoma ( P , 0.0001) (Table 1). Of the patients with a fi nal diagnosis of lymphoma, 21 (28%) had HL and 54 (72%) had NHL (36 low grade and 18 high grade).\nThree hundred sixty-nine lymph nodes and 19 mediastinal masses were sampled, with a median of 2 lymph nodes per patient. A median of fi ve needle passes were performed per lymph node (range, 3 -19). There was no difference in the number of passes between patients with and without lymphoma ( P = 0.27).\n\n## bility to Diagnose Lymphoma\n\nOf the 75 patients who were eventually diagnosed with lymphoma, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was diagnostic in 63 (84%). The likelihood ratio of each fi nding is shown in Table 2. The likelihood ratio of an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA demonstrating lymphoma was ' (95% CI, 11.192, ' ) because we considered all lymphoma results to be true positives. The likelihood ratio for granulomatous in fl ammation was 0.00 (95% CI, 0.00 -0.276). The likelihood ratio for inadequate and adequate lymphocytes combined was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.181 -0.545). Separately, the likelihood ratio for inadequate lymphocytes was 1.06 (95% CI, 0.24 -4.59), and the likelihood ratio for adequate lymphocytes was 0.25 (95% CI, 0.14 -0.49). Details of the likelihood ratio for de novo and recurrence strati fi ed separately can be found in Table E1 in the online supplement. False-negative results were found in 24% of HL samples, 22% of high-grade NHL samples, and 8% of low-grade NHL samples ( P = 0.19).\nDefinition of abbreviations : CI = confidence interval; Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA = endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration.\nDefinition of abbreviations : Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA=endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration.\n\n## bility to Diagnose and Subtype Lymphoma\n\nOf the 75 patients who were eventually diagnosed with lymphoma, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA established a diagnosis that could be subtyped in 58 (12 de novo and 46 relapsed). The sensitivity of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in these cases was 77% (95% CI, 0.68 -0.87). In 5\n(7%) of the 75 patients with lymphoma, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA diagnosed lymphoma, but the speci fi c subtype could not be established. These cases were regarded as false negatives in this analysis because they required a con fi rmatory biopsy (Table 3). The sensitivity of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for the cohort and different subsets is shown in Table 4.\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA had 67% (95% CI, 0.45 -0.88) sensitivity for identifying de novo lymphoma. Its sensitivity in patients with relapsed lymphoma was 81% (95% CI, 0.70 -0.91). There was no statistically signi fi cant difference between the sensitivities for de novo and relapsed lymphoma ( P = 0.33).\nDefinition of abbreviations : CI = confidence interval; Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA = endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration; NHL = nonHodgkin lymphoma; PPV = positive predictive value; NPV = negative predictive value.\nDefinition of abbreviation : Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA=endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration.\nFalse-negative results occurred more commonly with HL and high-grade NHL than with low-grade NHL (43% vs. 28% vs. 8%; P = 0.008). The difference between high-grade NHL and low-grade NHL was not statistically signi fi cant ( P = 0.10).\n\n## inal Other Malignant Diagnosis\n\nOther malignancies were ultimately diagnosed in 11 (6%) of the 181 patients. Small cell lung cancer was diagnosed in eight, and non -small cell lung cancer was diagnosed in three. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was diagnostic in all these patients.\n\n## inal Benign Diagnosis\n\nNinetyfi ve patients had benign diagnoses on the basis of clinical fi ndings, radiologic data, cultures, serologic fi ndings, and con fi rmatory biopsies. These included 11 patients with a speci fi c infection (2 mycobacterial and nine fungal), 18 with sarcoidosis, and 66 with a nonspeci fi c benign condition.\nAll 66 patients with nonspeci fi c benign diagnoses underwent clinical and imaging follow-up for a median of 18 months (range, 8 -52 mo). Of the 66 patients who had a nonspeci fi c benign diagnosis and in whom follow-up imaging was performed, 30 (45.5%) experienced a decrease in lymph node size and 36 (54.5%) experienced no change. No patients experienced an increase in lymph node size.\nA comparison of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA results and the fi nal diagnosis is shown in Table 5.\n\n## iscussion\n\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA established a diagnosis in 84% of patients with lymphoma. In association with fl ow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis, it had an overall sensitivity of 77%, speci fi city of 100%, and NPV of 86% in the diagnosis and subtyping of de novo and recurrent lymphoma. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA performed the best among patients with a fi nal diagnosis of low-grade NHL, with a 92% sensitivity rate. The sensitivity for HL was signi fi cantly lower; however, because of the small sample size, we could not demonstrate a difference between high- and low-grade NHL. Remarkably, no patients with granulomatous in fl ammation in our study developed or were diagnosed with lymphoma, which is contrary to the\ntraditional belief that granulomatous in fl ammation is indicative of persistent or new lymphoma (14).\nThe fi ndings in this study are similar to those of an earlier review of patients referred for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA between August 2005 and December 2006 at our institution (15). In that study, we reported our initial experience in 25 patients, among whom lymphoma was ultimately diagnosed in 11 patients. In that study, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA identi fi ed lymphoma in 10 (90.9%) of 11 patients with lymphoma, which is similar to the 84% we found in this study (15). However, in addition to the weakness inherent in any small study, one of the criticisms of our prior study was that patients in whom additional tissue was obtained for purposes of subtyping were included among the true positives. In that study, two patients identi fi ed as having lymphoma required additional biopsies for subtyping; thus, the ability of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA to diagnose and subtype lymphoma was 72.7%, which is similar to our present fi nding.\nThe sensitivity of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for diagnosing and subtyping lymphoma in this study was somewhat lower than the 89% reported by Moonim and coworkers; however, their analysis included 16 patients with paired tissue samples that provided an additional con fi rmation of the diagnosis, and they also described immunophenotyping techniques not routinely available in the United States (16). Interestingly, they reported that an EBUSTBNA diagnosis was adequate for clinical management in 52 (79%) of 66 lymphoma\ncases, a fi nding that is similar to our own. We found a much higher sensitivity than the 57% reported by Steinfort and colleagues (17), even after categorizing lymphoma that could not be subtyped as a false negative. That study, however, consisted of a far smaller patient population than that in our current study, with 44% of their patients suspected of sarcoidosis; in addition, the use of fl ow cytometry was not reported.\nOur fi ndings are in contrast to those reported by Iqbal and coworkers, who found an overall diagnostic sensitivity of 29% and a surprising nondiagnostic rate of 52% for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA (18). Our Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA technique is different from that reported by those authors. We typically use a 22-gauge needle, perform an average of fi ve passes per lymph node and perform cell counts to obtain 1 million cells. We also tend not to rely on subjective estimates of visible cores. Notably, on the basis of prior experience at our institution reported by Caraway and colleagues (19), immediate on-site assessment is necessary for an appropriate diagnostic workup of lymphoproliferative disorders in patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. We always triage material to ensure that adequate material is available for cytologic or ancillary studies, especially for immunophenotyping at the time of biopsy (19).\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was less sensitive for diagnosing HL in our study, which is consistent with the fi ndings of other investigators and may re fl ect the scarcity of the characteristic Reed-Sternberg cells that are needed for the diagnosis (Figure 1) (16).\nAdditional tissue was needed in 19% of HL cases versus 2% of NHL cases ( P = 0.009).\nIn our study, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA had many gradations of positive and negative results. As we observed, a positive diagnosis of lymphoma that can be subtyped is different from a positive diagnosis of lymphoma that cannot be subtyped, because treatment depends on the subtype. In some studies, a diagnosis of lymphoma in which the speci fi c subtype was not determined by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was considered a negative result (16). However, this result is not the same as having inadequate lymphocytes. An initial diagnosis of lymphoma justi fi es more invasive testing to determine the subtype. Similarly, a speci fi c nonlymphoma diagnosis is informative, even if it is negative for lymphoma. Although this is clinically obvious, the likelihood ratio provides subtle insights into these other categories of results. In this study, we found that the negative result of granulomatous in fl ammation reduced the probability of lymphoma to almost zero. This is different from a negative result of inadequate lymphocytes. However, when complex histologic interpretations are simpli fi ed as either positive or negative, this information is lost, as is the ability to discriminate.\nThe clinical implications of our fi ndings depend not only on the likelihood ratio but also on the pretest probability of disease. In patients with suspected de novo lymphoma, the prevalence of lymphoma was 26%. As Figure 2 shows, if the pretest probability of lymphoma is 26% and EBUSTBNA demonstrates adequate lymphocytes, the posterior probability will be 8%. In contrast, patients with suspected recurrent lymphoma have a higher pretest probability of disease, as would be expected. In this study, the prevalence of recurrent lymphoma was 51%. If the pretest probability of lymphoma is 51% and EBUSTBNA demonstrates adequate lymphocytes, the posterior probability will be 21%. In contrast, the posterior probability of disease will be much lower if Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA demonstrates granulomas, even in patients with a history of lymphoma.\nWe have integrated the concepts of pretest probability and likelihood ratios for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA into a new diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected lymphoma (Figure 3). If a patient has suspected de novo lymphoma and EBUSTBNA shows granulomatous in fl ammation or adequate lymphocytes, careful\nobservation with serial computed tomography (CT) and clinical follow-up is indicated, provided that the pretest probability is fairly low (as it was in our study and others) (15, 17, 20). On the one hand, if a patient has suspected recurrent lymphoma and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA shows granulomatous in fl ammation, observation and serial CT are required. On the other hand, if a patient has suspected recurrent lymphoma and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA shows adequate lymphocytes, the approach may\ndepend on the initial subtype of lymphoma. As in other studies, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA appears to be more sensitive for diagnosing lowgrade NHL than HL and high-grade NHL. Observation is indicated in patients with a history of low-grade NHL if the EBUSTBNA reveals adequate lymphocytes. However, in patients with HL or high-grade NHL, the use of another biopsy technique may be warranted.\nThe limitations of this study include its retrospective design, rather than being\na randomized trial or a study of multicenter registries. It involves a relatively small number of patients, and it is prone to selection bias because only patients referred for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA were included; patients referred directly for surgical sampling were not included. In addition, as the posterior probabilities in our study are contingent on the prior probabilities, our results may not be generalizable to other patient populations, owing to differing lymphoma prevalence. Our patients were evaluated in a dedicated cancer center, so a referral bias compared with other centers cannot be excluded. Among patients with no prior history of lymphoma, we made every effort to clinically exclude patients in whom granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis or mycobacterial disease was suspected.\nEven after clinicoradiographic workup, however, there is inevitably a group of patients that require invasive tissue sampling. Because isolated mediastinal lymphoma is a relatively rare disease, it is also inevitable that a majority of such patients will end up with diagnoses other than lymphoma. In studies of isolated intrathoracic adenopathy that was not particularly suspicious for de novo lymphoma, lymphoma prevalence was as low as 4% (21). The prevalence of de novo\nlymphoma in our study was 26%, which is very similar to other published studies in this patient population, in whom lymphoma prevalence has ranged from 21% to 60% (15 -17, 20).\nPatients with a history of lymphoma constitute an important group in whom the appearance of new intrathoracic adenopathy clearly raises the specter of recurrent lymphoma and usually warrants invasive testing. This level of suspicion is borne out by our fi ndings that fully 51% of these patients were ultimately diagnosed with lymphoma. This is very similar to prior published studies where the prevalence of lymphoma ranged between 43% and 61% for relapsed lymphoma, and our fi ndings suggest that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA can be very useful in this setting (15, 18, 19). For illustration purposes, we equated prevalence with pretest probability; however, clinical decision making should be driven by the pretest probability for an individual patient (based on the medical history, physical, and other diagnostic tests) rather than by the prevalence in a population. Also, the number for de novo lymphoma cases is small in our study; the con fi dence intervals are wide; and the generalizability of the fi ndings may be limited because of the small sample size for this particular subgroup of patients.\nThe generalizability of our results also depends on the amount of pathology resources available and the specimen handling methods used. Our study population received care at a dedicated cancer center with a multidisciplinary team approach that included on-site cytopathology support and dedicated hematopathologists. Particularly among patients with suspected lymphoma relapse, the pathologists were not blinded to the prior history, and this could have in fl uenced the results. All our samples were screened on site for cellularity, and quantitative cell counts were performed to con fi rm the samples ' adequacy for ancillary testing, including fl ow cytometry. This screening allowed us to make procedural decisions, such as increasing the number of passes to maximize the yield. In addition, when granulomas or lymphocytes were found on rapid on-site evaluation, cultures were obtained to provide a de fi nitive diagnosis. If these resources are not available and used in conjunction with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, EBUSTBNA may not perform as well.\nIn summary, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is effective at diagnosing suspected lymphoma in patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The present study, with 75 lymphoma cases, is the largest case series thus far describing the\nperformance characteristics of EBUSTBNA in this population. We also demonstrated that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA not only can diagnose the presence of lymphoma but also can provide suf fi cient information for subtyping in most cases. Also, by using likelihood ratios rather\nthan conventional sensitivity and speci fi city, we demonstrated that certain Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA fi ndings, such as granulomas, are associated with a low posterior probability of lymphoma. Given the higher discriminatory function and superior ability to predict posterior\nprobability of disease, LRs may be more useful for clinical decision making than conventional sensitivity and speci fi city. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.\n\n## eferences\n\n1 Dong HY, Harris NL, Preffer FI, Pitman MB.

      "content": "Background: Excisional biopsies are typically used to diagnose lymphoma, but data suggest that endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA) is equally effective. In this study, we determined whether Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA could accurately diagnose and subtype lymphoma.\nMethods: The cases of patients who had undergone Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for suspected lymphoma were retrospectively reviewed. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA results were categorized as lymphoma, speci fi c nonlymphomadiagnosis, granulomatous in fl ammation, or adequate or inadequate lymphocytes with no speci fi c diagnosis. To quantify the ability of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA to diagnose lymphoma, we used likelihood ratios. To quantify the ability of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA to diagnose and subtype lymphoma, we calculated sensitivity and speci fi city. For this analysis, lymphoma that could be subtyped on the basis of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was classi fi ed as a true positive; lymphoma that could not be subtyped was classi fi ed as a false negative.\nResults: Of the 181 patients included, 75 (41.5%) were ultimately diagnosed with lymphoma. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was able to establish a diagnosis of lymphoma in 63 patients (84%). Granulomatous in fl ammation diagnosed on the basis of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was associated with a low likelihood of lymphoma being present (likelihood ratio, 0.00; 95% con fi dence interval [CI], 0.00 -0.276). Adequate lymphocytes were associated with a low likelihood of lymphoma (LR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.14 -0.49). Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was able to establish a diagnosis and subtype the lymphoma in 67% (95% CI, 0.45 -0.88) of patients with de novo lymphoma and 81% (95% CI, 0.70 -0.91) of patients with relapsed lymphoma.\nConclusions: Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is an effective, minimally invasive diagnostic test for patients with suspected lymphoma and can provide valuable clinical information, even with ' negative ' results.\nKeywords: endobronchial ultrasound -guided fi ne needle aspiration; lymphoma; mediastinal lymphadenopathy\n(Received in original form March 20, 2015; accepted in final form June 17, 2015)\nAuthor Contributions : H.B.G.: principal investigator and was responsible for the study design; H.B.G., D.O., G.A.E., and X.L. contributed to the data analysis and the writing of the manuscript; M.I.: contributed to data collection; N.P.C., L.J.M., R.F.C., C.A.J., and R.C.M.: contributed to performing the procedures, data collection, and data entry; and H.B.G., D.O., G.A.E., N.P.C., L.J.M., R.F.C., C.A.J., and R.C.M.: contributed to reviewing and editing the manuscript.\nCorrespondence and requests for reprints should be addressed to Horiana B.

The WHO recommends the use of multidimensional diagnostic modalities, including cytomorphologic studies, immunophenotyping, cytogenetic analyses, and molecular studies to accurately subtype lymphoma (1 -4).\nSurgical excision and core biopsy are the current preferred sampling techniques for\ndiagnosing lymphoma, but there is growing interest in using less invasive endoscopic techniques with lower complication rates (5). In patients who present with intrathoracic adenopathy that is suspicious for lymphoma, endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUSTBNA) is an attractive option, given the risks of surgical or core needle sampling (6, 7). In such patients, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA also may\nbe useful for excluding alternative diagnoses, such as sarcoidosis, and may help to identify patients who require more invasive tissue sampling (8, 9).\nThe diagnostic utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in lung cancer diagnosis and staging, including biomarker analysis, has been well established (10, 11). Emerging data suggest that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, along with appropriate immunohistochemical, fl ow cytometric,\ncytogenetic, and molecular studies, can de fi nitively diagnose lymphoma (12, 13). Nonetheless, because disease management often hinges on the pathologic subtype and grade, there is concern that the smaller samples obtained via Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA compared with those obtained by surgical or core needle biopsy may be insuf fi cient to guide treatment decisions. Even in our high-volume dedicated cancer center, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is only used in a minority of patients with suspected lymphoma.\nThere is a paucity of data on whether Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA provides adequate tissue samples for diagnosing and subtyping lymphoma (i.e., no additional biopsies are required for pathologic subtyping and grading). Additionally, sensitivity and speci fi city have been reported in most of the studies on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for lymphoma in the literature; however, sensitivity and speci fi city can have only two possible results: positive or negative. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA typically has more than two meaningful possible results. For diagnostic tests in which there are more than two meaningful results, the use of likelihood ratios is more appropriate, because it re fl ects the information value of each of the categories separately. Therefore, in this study, we determined on the basis of likelihood ratios whether Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA could accurately diagnose and subtype lymphoma in patients with isolated intrathoracic adenopathy that was suspicious for lymphoma.",

Lymphoma that could be subtyped : Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was diagnostic of lymphoma and subtyping was possible using solely the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA sample; no additional tissue sampling was required.\n2. Lymphoma that could not be subtyped : Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA demonstrated cells that were consistent with lymphoma on the basis of cytomorphologic or immunophenotypic features, but additional tissue sampling was required to subtype the disease.\n3. Speci fi c nonlymphoma diagnosis : EBUSTBNA diagnosed a condition other than lymphoma. For example, the fi nding of acid-fast organisms in addition to granulomas was consistent with mycobacterial disease. The fi nding of other forms of cancer was also considered de fi nitive.\n4.

      "content": "We studied the ability of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA to diagnose lymphoma by asking two distinct questions. The fi rst was how effective EBUSTBNAwas in determining whether a patient had lymphoma. However, identifying that a patient has lymphoma is not always suf fi cient, because the precise subtype of lymphoma dictates treatment. Therefore, the second question was how effective Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was in determining the subtype of lymphoma present so that treatment decisions could be made.\nTo determine whether Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA could diagnose lymphoma, we used likelihood ratios. We considered all patients with a fi nal diagnosis of de novo or relapsed lymphoma to have lymphoma; this served\nas the reference standard of truth. Patients with any other fi nal diagnosis were considered not to have lymphoma. A diagnosis of lymphoma included all lymphomas, even those that could not be\nsubtyped. We used likelihood ratios to determine whether Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA could diagnose lymphoma because they allow the interpretation of diagnostic tests that have more than two possible results.\nDefinition of abbreviations : Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)=endobronchial ultrasound; FDG= fluorodeoxyglucose; NHL = non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nFor the outcome of the ability of EBUSTBNA to diagnose and subtype lymphoma, we calculated sensitivity and speci fi city. For this analysis, all Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA lymphoma results that could be subtyped were classi fi ed as true positives. Those that could not be subtyped were classi fi ed as negative. All other Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA results were also classi fi ed as negative for lymphoma. The reference standard for determining sensitivity and speci fi city was the fi nal diagnosis.

We applied Bayes ' theorem to further re fi ne the diagnostic utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for lymphoma diagnosis.

      "content": "Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA established a diagnosis in 84% of patients with lymphoma. In association with fl ow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis, it had an overall sensitivity of 77%, speci fi city of 100%, and NPV of 86% in the diagnosis and subtyping of de novo and recurrent lymphoma. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA performed the best among patients with a fi nal diagnosis of low-grade NHL, with a 92% sensitivity rate. The sensitivity for HL was signi fi cantly lower; however, because of the small sample size, we could not demonstrate a difference between high- and low-grade NHL. Remarkably, no patients with granulomatous in fl ammation in our study developed or were diagnosed with lymphoma, which is contrary to the\ntraditional belief that granulomatous in fl ammation is indicative of persistent or new lymphoma (14).\nThe fi ndings in this study are similar to those of an earlier review of patients referred for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA between August 2005 and December 2006 at our institution (15). In that study, we reported our initial experience in 25 patients, among whom lymphoma was ultimately diagnosed in 11 patients. In that study, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA identi fi ed lymphoma in 10 (90.9%) of 11 patients with lymphoma, which is similar to the 84% we found in this study (15). However, in addition to the weakness inherent in any small study, one of the criticisms of our prior study was that patients in whom additional tissue was obtained for purposes of subtyping were included among the true positives. In that study, two patients identi fi ed as having lymphoma required additional biopsies for subtyping; thus, the ability of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA to diagnose and subtype lymphoma was 72.7%, which is similar to our present fi nding.\nThe sensitivity of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for diagnosing and subtyping lymphoma in this study was somewhat lower than the 89% reported by Moonim and coworkers; however, their analysis included 16 patients with paired tissue samples that provided an additional con fi rmation of the diagnosis, and they also described immunophenotyping techniques not routinely available in the United States (16). Interestingly, they reported that an EBUSTBNA diagnosis was adequate for clinical management in 52 (79%) of 66 lymphoma\ncases, a fi nding that is similar to our own. We found a much higher sensitivity than the 57% reported by Steinfort and colleagues (17), even after categorizing lymphoma that could not be subtyped as a false negative. That study, however, consisted of a far smaller patient population than that in our current study, with 44% of their patients suspected of sarcoidosis; in addition, the use of fl ow cytometry was not reported.\nOur fi ndings are in contrast to those reported by Iqbal and coworkers, who found an overall diagnostic sensitivity of 29% and a surprising nondiagnostic rate of 52% for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA (18). Our Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA technique is different from that reported by those authors. We typically use a 22-gauge needle, perform an average of fi ve passes per lymph node and perform cell counts to obtain 1 million cells. We also tend not to rely on subjective estimates of visible cores. Notably, on the basis of prior experience at our institution reported by Caraway and colleagues (19), immediate on-site assessment is necessary for an appropriate diagnostic workup of lymphoproliferative disorders in patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. We always triage material to ensure that adequate material is available for cytologic or ancillary studies, especially for immunophenotyping at the time of biopsy (19).\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was less sensitive for diagnosing HL in our study, which is consistent with the fi ndings of other investigators and may re fl ect the scarcity of the characteristic Reed-Sternberg cells that are needed for the diagnosis (Figure 1) (16).\nAdditional tissue was needed in 19% of HL cases versus 2% of NHL cases ( P = 0.009).\nIn our study, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA had many gradations of positive and negative results. As we observed, a positive diagnosis of lymphoma that can be subtyped is different from a positive diagnosis of lymphoma that cannot be subtyped, because treatment depends on the subtype. In some studies, a diagnosis of lymphoma in which the speci fi c subtype was not determined by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was considered a negative result (16). However, this result is not the same as having inadequate lymphocytes. An initial diagnosis of lymphoma justi fi es more invasive testing to determine the subtype. Similarly, a speci fi c nonlymphoma diagnosis is informative, even if it is negative for lymphoma. Although this is clinically obvious, the likelihood ratio provides subtle insights into these other categories of results. In this study, we found that the negative result of granulomatous in fl ammation reduced the probability of lymphoma to almost zero. This is different from a negative result of inadequate lymphocytes. However, when complex histologic interpretations are simpli fi ed as either positive or negative, this information is lost, as is the ability to discriminate.\nThe clinical implications of our fi ndings depend not only on the likelihood ratio but also on the pretest probability of disease. In patients with suspected de novo lymphoma, the prevalence of lymphoma was 26%. As Figure 2 shows, if the pretest probability of lymphoma is 26% and EBUSTBNA demonstrates adequate lymphocytes, the posterior probability will be 8%. In contrast, patients with suspected recurrent lymphoma have a higher pretest probability of disease, as would be expected. In this study, the prevalence of recurrent lymphoma was 51%. If the pretest probability of lymphoma is 51% and EBUSTBNA demonstrates adequate lymphocytes, the posterior probability will be 21%. In contrast, the posterior probability of disease will be much lower if Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA demonstrates granulomas, even in patients with a history of lymphoma.\nWe have integrated the concepts of pretest probability and likelihood ratios for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA into a new diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected lymphoma (Figure 3). If a patient has suspected de novo lymphoma and EBUSTBNA shows granulomatous in fl ammation or adequate lymphocytes, careful\nobservation with serial computed tomography (CT) and clinical follow-up is indicated, provided that the pretest probability is fairly low (as it was in our study and others) (15, 17, 20). On the one hand, if a patient has suspected recurrent lymphoma and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA shows granulomatous in fl ammation, observation and serial CT are required. On the other hand, if a patient has suspected recurrent lymphoma and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA shows adequate lymphocytes, the approach may\ndepend on the initial subtype of lymphoma. As in other studies, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA appears to be more sensitive for diagnosing lowgrade NHL than HL and high-grade NHL. Observation is indicated in patients with a history of low-grade NHL if the EBUSTBNA reveals adequate lymphocytes. However, in patients with HL or high-grade NHL, the use of another biopsy technique may be warranted.\nThe limitations of this study include its retrospective design, rather than being\na randomized trial or a study of multicenter registries. It involves a relatively small number of patients, and it is prone to selection bias because only patients referred for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA were included; patients referred directly for surgical sampling were not included. In addition, as the posterior probabilities in our study are contingent on the prior probabilities, our results may not be generalizable to other patient populations, owing to differing lymphoma prevalence. Our patients were evaluated in a dedicated cancer center, so a referral bias compared with other centers cannot be excluded. Among patients with no prior history of lymphoma, we made every effort to clinically exclude patients in whom granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis or mycobacterial disease was suspected.\nEven after clinicoradiographic workup, however, there is inevitably a group of patients that require invasive tissue sampling. Because isolated mediastinal lymphoma is a relatively rare disease, it is also inevitable that a majority of such patients will end up with diagnoses other than lymphoma. In studies of isolated intrathoracic adenopathy that was not particularly suspicious for de novo lymphoma, lymphoma prevalence was as low as 4% (21). The prevalence of de novo\nlymphoma in our study was 26%, which is very similar to other published studies in this patient population, in whom lymphoma prevalence has ranged from 21% to 60% (15 -17, 20).\nPatients with a history of lymphoma constitute an important group in whom the appearance of new intrathoracic adenopathy clearly raises the specter of recurrent lymphoma and usually warrants invasive testing. This level of suspicion is borne out by our fi ndings that fully 51% of these patients were ultimately diagnosed with lymphoma. This is very similar to prior published studies where the prevalence of lymphoma ranged between 43% and 61% for relapsed lymphoma, and our fi ndings suggest that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA can be very useful in this setting (15, 18, 19). For illustration purposes, we equated prevalence with pretest probability; however, clinical decision making should be driven by the pretest probability for an individual patient (based on the medical history, physical, and other diagnostic tests) rather than by the prevalence in a population. Also, the number for de novo lymphoma cases is small in our study; the con fi dence intervals are wide; and the generalizability of the fi ndings may be limited because of the small sample size for this particular subgroup of patients.\nThe generalizability of our results also depends on the amount of pathology resources available and the specimen handling methods used. Our study population received care at a dedicated cancer center with a multidisciplinary team approach that included on-site cytopathology support and dedicated hematopathologists. Particularly among patients with suspected lymphoma relapse, the pathologists were not blinded to the prior history, and this could have in fl uenced the results. All our samples were screened on site for cellularity, and quantitative cell counts were performed to con fi rm the samples ' adequacy for ancillary testing, including fl ow cytometry. This screening allowed us to make procedural decisions, such as increasing the number of passes to maximize the yield. In addition, when granulomas or lymphocytes were found on rapid on-site evaluation, cultures were obtained to provide a de fi nitive diagnosis. If these resources are not available and used in conjunction with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, EBUSTBNA may not perform as well.\nIn summary, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is effective at diagnosing suspected lymphoma in patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The present study, with 75 lymphoma cases, is the largest case series thus far describing the\nperformance characteristics of EBUSTBNA in this population. We also demonstrated that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA not only can diagnose the presence of lymphoma but also can provide suf fi cient information for subtyping in most cases. Also, by using likelihood ratios rather\nthan conventional sensitivity and speci fi city, we demonstrated that certain Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA fi ndings, such as granulomas, are associated with a low posterior probability of lymphoma. Given the higher discriminatory function and superior ability to predict posterior\nprobability of disease, LRs may be more useful for clinical decision making than conventional sensitivity and speci fi city. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.",
