ENB reported a pooled sensitivity of 77% (95% CI, 72%-82%; I 2 1\u20444 80.6%) and a speci fi city of 100% (95% CI, 99%-100%; I 2 1\u20444 0%) for malignancy. The sROC showed an area under the curve of 0.955 ( P 1\u20444 .03). ENB achieved a suf fi cient sample for ancillary tests in 90.9% (95% CI, 84.8%-96.9%; I 2 1\u20444 80.7%). Risk of pneumothorax was 2.0% (95% CI, 1.0-3.0; I 2 1\u20444 45.2%). We found subgroup differences according to the risk of bias and the number of sampling techniques. Meta-regression showed an association between sensitivity and the mean distance of the sensor tip to the center of the nodule, the number of tissue sampling techniques, and the cancer prevalence in the study.\nINTERPRETATION: ENB is very safe with good sensitivity for diagnosing malignancy in patients with PPLs.

According to current clinical practice guidelines, a minimally invasive approach is strongly recommended for patients with pulmonary nodules or lesions suspected of lung cancer. 2 For lesions proximal to central airways, procedures such as endobronchial ultrasound needle aspiration have a sensitivity of > 90% and a speci fi city of > 95% for diagnosis and mediastinal staging. 2,3 Although evidence regarding suspicious lesions near the central airways is strong, accuracy for peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) suspected of lung cancer is variable. Furthermore, data regarding the accuracy of radial endobronchial ultrasound needle aspiration (r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) is only fair, with the AQuIRe registry reporting a diagnostic yield of 57%. 4 In an attempt to improve the yield, several imageguided biopsy diagnostic tools have been developed in the last decade. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) allows physicians to access PPLs beyond the reach of conventional bronchoscopy through a minimally invasive method, using an image-guided fl exible catheter and a dedicated navigation software system (superDimension [Medtronic], SpiNDrive [Veran], etc). 5 This procedure is an alternative to transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA), a procedure with a sensitivity for detecting malignancy of 92.1%. 6 Despite displaying a good sensitivity for cancer diagnosis, TTNA accounts for pneumothorax rates of 25.3% when core biopsy is performed and 18.8% when fi ne needle aspiration is performed, requiring chest tube placement in up to 11.9% of cases. 7\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the sensitivity and safety of ENB for the sampling of PPLs suspected of lung cancer.\n\n## aterials and Methods\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the current recommendation from the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies statement. 8 Full protocol and register were previously published in the PROSPERO database (CRD 42019109449).\n\n## iterature Search\n\nA highly sensitive database search was conducted by a review author (G. L.), without language restriction, using the following databases: PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, LILACS (www.scielo.org), Clinical Trials (ClinicalTrials.gov), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com), Scirus (www.scirus. com/srsapp), ISI Web of Knowledge (www.isiwebofknowledge.com), and Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com). An initial literature search was performed in May 2019 and updated in November 2019. References from the included studies were also manually searched along with the abstracts of potential studies presented in conferences from 2014 through 2019 by the American Thoracic Society, American College of Chest Physicians, European Respiratory Society,\nand American Association for Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology. The full literature search strategy is available in eAppendix 1.\nInclusion Criteria: Criteria for inclusion were as follows: (1) ENB used for diagnosis of PPLs, (2) diagnosis con fi rmed histologically or by close clinical follow-up, and (3) studies that stated a clear reference standard for establishing diagnostic sensitivity. We excluded review papers, letters, or studies in which data to calculate sensitivity for malignancy was insuf fi cient. Studies were selected for inclusion only after both reviewers assessed the full text.\nSelection of Studies: The references identi fi ed after the literature search were included in Covidence software (Veritas Health Innovation Ltd). A highly speci fi c hand search screening of both titles and abstracts was independently performed by two review authors (G. L. and D. O.-D.). Eligible studies were evaluated in full text and selected according to our prespeci fi ed inclusion and exclusion criteria; any disagreement was resolved by discussion.\nData Extraction and Quality Assessment: Two independent reviewers (G. L. and D. O.-D.) extracted data from each study. The following information was collected: fi rst author, publication year, publication type (retrospective or prospective), number of participants, index test, reference standard, number of techniques, true positives (TPs), false positives (FPs), true negatives (TNs), false negatives (FNs), use of rapid on-site examination (ROSE) (yes or no), nodule size, fl uoroscopy use (yes or no), r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) use (yes or no), cancer prevalence, and successful navigation to the target lesion. Cancer prevalence was de fi ned as the total lung cancer cases (TPs \u00fe FNs) divided by the total population included in each study. Successful navigation was de fi ned as the number of lesions in which navigation was successful divided by the number of lesions in which navigation was attempted.\nQuality assessment was performed using the QUADAS-2 tool 9 by two reviewers (G. L. and D. O.-D.). We rated the risk of bias because of\nBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; the Virginia Cancer Specialists (Dr Khandhar), Inova Health, Fairfax, VA; the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr Mehta and Jantz), University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; and the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Mayo Clinic (Dr Fernandez-Bussy), Jacksonville, FL.\nFUNDING/SUPPORT: The authors have reported to CHEST that no funding was received for this study.\nCORRESPONDENCE TO: Erik E.

Finally, we rated the overall risk of bias and categorized it as low risk or high risk according to the results of the QUADAS-2 analysis. Any disagreement was resolved by a third reviewer (F. K.).\nData Analysis: Pooled data were analyzed and imported in a two-bytwo contingency table. The principle outcome was de fi ned as the pooled sensitivity of ENB for malignancy (lung cancer). Sensitivity was calculated as TP/TP \u00fe FN, including the total navigation cases (successful and nonsuccessful navigation). Speci fi city (TN/TN \u00fe FP), negative likelihood ratio, and positive likelihood ratio were also reported. For quantitative analyses, we performed a proportions meta-analysis after a binomial distribution. 10 We used the metaprop command with a Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation on STATA software version 14.2 (Stata Corp) 11 and Open Meta Analyst software (Brown University). 12 We also created a summary receiver operatic characteristic curve. 10,13 All results were expressed as a percentage and a 95% CI with an alpha value of 0.05.\nInterstudy heterogeneity (percentage of total variation across studies that is caused by heterogeneity rather than chance) was measured using visual inspection of a forest plot and an I 2 test. Signi fi cant heterogeneity was de fi ned as an I 2 > 75% and nonsigni fi cant was de fi ned as I 2 < 40% according to previous publications. 14 In the case of signi fi cant heterogeneity, subgroup analysis evaluating possible explanations of the difference between groups was explored. 15 We prespeci fi ed the following variables as potential subgroups: (1) risk of bias of included studies, (2) type of navigation system used (superDimension or others), (3) use of ROSE, (4) use of fl uoroscopy guidance, (5) type of anesthesia (general, conscious sedation, or both), (6) r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) use, (7) time interval in which the study was performed, and (8) number of sampling techniques used in association to ENB. Finally, heterogeneity between subgroups was assessed with a Q test.\nThe potential for publication bias was evaluated through both visual inspection of the funnel plot and Egger test. Asymmetry in the distribution of the studies in the funnel plot raised concerns about serious publication bias. 16\nComplementary Analysis: Adequacy of the Sample Achieved by ENB and Association Between Sensitivity and Covariables: A random effects model was used in cases in which heterogeneity between studies was high. A fi xed random effects model was used in cases in which this heterogeneity was low. For overall sensitivity, both models were used, and results were compared. We performed two complementary data analyses. For the fi rst analysis, we explored the association between pooled sensitivity for the diagnosis of malignancy and continuous variables related to ENB procedure through a metaregression. The dependent variable was de fi ned as the pooled sensitivity for lung cancer. We used the following independent continuous covariables related to ENB procedures to run the model: cancer prevalence, distance between tip of sensor and center of nodule, duration of the procedure, number of sampling techniques used in association to ENB, and nodule size. 17 For the second complementary analysis, we explored the adequacy of samples obtained through ENB to test for driver oncogenes. In this case, we performed a binary effect meta-analysis after a maximum likelihood method. A suf fi cient sample was de fi ned as a sample obtained using ENB that allowed the performance of the ancillary test. For calculation, we used the proportion of participants in which a suf fi cient sample was achieved relative to all participants in which a sample for ancillary testing was attempted as an effect measure.\nSafety Analysis: Additionally, we reviewed the safety of ENB by assessing the proportion of patients that developed the following adverse events: (1) pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement; (2) minor bronchopulmonary bleeding, de fi ned as bleeding that stopped spontaneously in < 5 min or with the use of a Fogarty balloon; (3) major bronchopulmonary bleeding, de fi ned as bleeding that did not meet minor bleeding criteria; (4) acute respiratory failure; and (5) need for a repeat biopsy.\nThe effect measure used was the proportion of participants who developed the adverse event relative to all the participants included in each study.\nFinally, we created a summary of fi ndings table of the diagnostic test results, 18 and the quality of evidence was rated by a panel (G. L. and F. K.) following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.\n\n## verview of Eligible Trials\n\nA thorough electronic database search retrieved 2,198 citations from different sources and 160 potential studies were identi fi ed for analysis. After examining those articles, 75 articles were suitable for full-text review, and 35 articles were excluded. A total of 40 studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative analyses. 19-58 A summary of the literature search following the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies statement is shown in Figure 1.\n\n## tudy Characteristics\n\nThe summary of the study characteristics is shown in Table 1. A total of 3,342 participants were extracted from the selected articles with a mean age of 64.5 years.\nOut of 40 studies, 18 were conducted in North America (45%), 10 in Europe (25%), nine in Asia (22.5%), two in both the United States and Europe (5%), and one in Oceania (2.5%). The median number of participants per study was 35 (range, 10-1,157), and successful navigation to the target lesion was achieved in 3,290 of 3,356 PPLs (98%) included. When the number of centers was evaluated, 37 (92.5%) studies were conducted in a single center and three (7.5%) were multicenter (range, 2-29 centers). Regarding study design, 21 (52.5%) were retrospective and 19 (47.5%) were prospective trials. Two studies were double-arm. 23,53 The superDimension system was used in 38 studies (95%). The average lesion size was 23.2 mm (range, 15-39.8 mm), the average mean distance between the tip of the sensor and the center of the nodule was 8.2 mm (range, 6.3-12.2 mm), and the mean duration of the procedure was 46.3 min (range, 16.8-95.3 min). The average cancer prevalence\nwas 66% (median, 48.2%; range, 20%-92%), and the mean follow-up period was 14.3 months (median, 12; range, 3-24 months).\n\n## uality Assessment\n\nThe risk of bias was evaluated in all studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. Out of 40 studies, 19 reported low risk of bias in most aspects; however, a high or unclear risk of bias regarding patient selection, index test, and the reference standard was found in most studies because no proper reference standard was used. The de fi nition of navigation success varied across the studies, possibly resulting in selective reporting. A full report of the risk of bias assessment is shown in Table 2.\n\n## ensitivity of ENB\n\nA total of 40 studies were included in the quantitative analysis, including 3,342 participants pooled in the meta-analysis. The overall sensitivity of ENB for the diagnosis of lung cancer was 77% (95% CI, 72%-82%; I 2 1\u20444 80.6%) using a random effects model (Figure 2); when a fi xed effects model was done, sensitivity only dropped to 76% (95% CI, 74%-78%; I 2 1\u20444 0%). Speci fi city was 100% (95% CI, 99%-100%; I 2 1\u20444 0%) (Figure 2). The negative likelihood ratio was 0.2 (95% CI, 0.1-0.3; I 2 1\u20444 0%) and the positive likelihood ratio was\n15.8 (95% CI, 10.3-24.2; I 2 1\u20444 0%). The summary receiver operatic characteristic curve showed an area under the curve of 0.95 (SE, 0.01; P 1\u20444 .03) (e-Figure 1). Based on a visual inspection of the funnel plot (e-Figure 2), publication bias was low. Egger test was nonsigni fi cant ( P 1\u20444 .16). Finally, using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach, diagnostic sensitivity and speci fi city were determined to be low because of the risk of bias and imprecision (high heterogeneity between studies) (Table 3).\n\n## ubgroup Analysis and Explaining Heterogeneity\n\nA summary of the subgroup analysis is presented in Table 4. Analysis according to the risk of bias showed that studies with high risk had a sensitivity of 66.9% (95% CI, 59%-74%; I 2 1\u20444 78.5%), whereas sensitivity increased to 77.1% (95% CI, 71.2%-82.1%; I 2 1\u20444 60.2%) when studies had a low risk. There was signi fi cant heterogeneity between subgroups with a Q statistic of P < .01.\nA subgroup analysis of studies over time showed no differences in sensitivity when studies were grouped in 2-year intervals. The time interval with the lowest sensitivity was 2015 to 2016, with only a 64% pooled\n]\n\n## able 1 ] (Continued)\n\n(Continued)\n]\n\n## able 1 ] (Continued)\n\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) 1\u20444 endobronchial ultrasound needle aspiration; ENB 1\u20444 electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy; FNA 1\u20444 fi ne needle aspiration; PPL 1\u20444 peripheral pulmonary lesion; RCT 1\u20444 randomized controlled trial; TTNA 1\u20444 transthoracic needle aspiration; VATS 1\u20444 video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.\nH 1\u20444 high risk of bias; L 1\u20444 low risk of bias; U 1\u20444 unclear risk of bias.\nsensitivity. The heterogeneity between subgroups was nonsigni fi cant with a Q statistic of P 1\u20444 .55.\nAlthough different navigation systems were used, similar sensitivities were reported. Used in 38 studies, the superDimension system had a pooled sensitivity of 78% (95% CI, 73%-83%; I 2 1\u20444 81.31). Two studies included in the analysis used other navigation systems, with a pooled sensitivity of 70% (95% CI, 54%-84%; I 2 1\u20444 not applicable). There was no signi fi cant heterogeneity between subgroups with a Q statistic of 0.37.\nThe type of sedation used showed no difference in the pooled sensitivity between subgroups. General anesthesia was used in 16 studies; the pooled sensitivity for this group was 74% (95% CI, 66%-81%; I 2 1\u20444 69.3%). On the other hand, 15 studies used only conscious\nsedation, with a pooled sensitivity of 75% (95% CI, 65%84%; I 2 1\u20444 81.8%). Four studies used a mix of general anesthesia and conscious sedation, with a pooled sensitivity of 74% (95% CI, 65%-81%; I 2 1\u20444 62.7%). However, there was no signi fi cant heterogeneity between subgroups with P 1\u20444 .09.\nUsing complementary techniques such as ROSE, r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), or fl uoroscopy did not result in differences in pooled sensitivity between subgroups. First, use of ROSE was reported in 20 studies, and pooled analysis showed a sensitivity of 76% (95% CI, 69%-83%; I 2 1\u20444 83.0%), whereas sensitivity for ENB without ROSE was reported in 14 studies, with a pooled sensitivity of 81% (95% CI, 74%-88%; I 2 1\u20444 67.7%), with no signi fi cant heterogeneity between subgroups ( P 1\u20444 .51). A total of 19 studies\nreported fl uoroscopy guidance in association with ENB, with a sensitivity of 74% (95% CI, 65%-81%; I 2 1\u20444 84.2%) compared with 15 studies that reported ENB without fl uoroscopy, with a pooled sensitivity of 83% (95% CI, 71.7%-89%; I 2 1\u20444 62.7%), without signi fi cant heterogeneity between subgroups ( P 1\u20444 .09). Finally, the use of r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) reported a pooled sensitivity of 80% (95% CI, 74%-83%; I 2 1\u20444 73%) compared with 72% (95% CI, 66%-76%; I 2 1\u20444 85.5%) without r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS).\nRegarding the number of sampling techniques used in association with ENB, different combinations of forceps, brush, needle, cryoprobe, GenCut (Medtronic), and triple needle brush were reported, including seven studies reporting one technique with a pooled sensitivity of 67% (95% CI, 53%-79%; I 2 1\u20444 75.8%), 11 studies reporting two techniques with a pooled sensitivity of 72% (95% CI, 60%-83%; I 2 1\u20444 82.2%), 19 studies reporting three techniques with a pooled sensitivity of\n83% (95% CI, 76%-89%; I 2 1\u20444 75.1%), one study using four sampling techniques with a sensitivity of 91% (95% CI, 82%-96%), and two studies using fi ve different techniques, with a pooled sensitivity of 72% (95% CI, 69%-76%; I 2 1\u20444 not applicable).\nWe found signi fi cant heterogeneity between subgroups ( P < .01).\n\n## ensitivity Analysis: Meta-Regression Report\n\nWe found statistically signi fi cant positive associations between sensitivity and cancer prevalence reported as a beta regression coef fi cient of 3.45 (95% CI, 2.28-4.61; SE, 0.59; P # .001), and between sensitivity and number of sampling techniques with a beta coef fi cient of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.07-0.58; SE, 0.13; P 1\u20444 .011). We also found a statistically signi fi cant negative association between sensitivity and mean distance between the tip of sensor and center of nodule, with a beta regression coef fi cient\n]\nof /C0 0.38 (95% CI, /C0 0.66 to /C0 0.19; SE, 0.14; P 1\u20444 .006). Finally, we found no statistically signi fi cant association between sensitivity and average nodule size. A summary of meta-regression results is shown in Table 5.\n\n## dequacy of Samples Obtained by ENB\n\nA total of three studies, 46,50,57 including 610 participants, reported data on the adequacy of samples obtained by ENB to perform driver oncogene testing in patients with a positive biopsy result. All studies were published after 2015. The meta-analysis reported an adequate sample proportion of 90.9% (95% CI, 84.8%96.9%; I 2 1\u20444 80.7%).\n\n## afety Analysis\n\nA summary of adverse events reported in each study is available in e-Table 1. Complication rates after ENB were reported in 39 studies, including a total of 3,253 participants with 3,204 PPLs from data analyses across individual studies (exclusion criteria for individual studies were broad). One study did not report adverse events. 40 Pooled analysis showed a 2.0% rate of pneumothorax (95% CI, 1.0%-3.0%; I 2 1\u20444 42.5%) (Figure 3), risk of minor bronchopulmonary bleeding of 1.0% (95% CI, 0.6%-1.3%; I 2 1\u20444 0%), risk of major bronchopulmonary bleeding of 0.8% (95% CI, 0.5%1.1%; I 2 1\u20444 0%), and risk of acute respiratory failure of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.4%-0.9%; I 2 1\u20444 0%.) Forest plots for different complications are shown in e-Figs 3-6.\n\n## iscussion\n\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis showed the following: (1) ENB has an overall sensitivity of 77%, a speci fi city of 100%, a positive likelihood ratio of 15.79, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.23 for diagnosing PPLs suspected of lung cancer; (2) potential sources of heterogeneity were seen in both risk of bias and number of sampling techniques, with no signi fi cant heterogeneity between subgroups noted when navigation system, ROSE, fl uoroscopy guidance, anesthesia type, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), or time interval in which the study was performed; (3) sensitivity was associated with lung cancer prevalence, number of sampling techniques used, and mean distance between the tip of the sensor and the center of the nodule; (4) ENB is a very safe procedure with a 2.0% risk of pneumothorax and a risk of any bleeding or respiratory failure of < 1%; and (5) ENB can obtain adequate samples for testing driver oncogenes in 90% of positive biopsies in which additional testing is needed.\nSensitivity was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.72-0.82), speci fi city was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.99-1.00), and prevalence was 66%. Prevalence was estimated using a pooled analysis of included studies. a Pretest probability from the pooled prevalence of lung cancer from included studies.

Wang Memoli et al 59 quantitatively analyzed 39 studies (prior to 2010) that described alternative PPL exploration techniques (r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), ENB, etc). The authors reported a diagnostic yield for any diagnoses of 70%, with a pneumothorax rate of 1.5%. 59 A study by Gex et al 60 described the diagnostic accuracy for any diagnoses of ENB including 15 trials with an overall accuracy of 73.9%, a sensitivity of 71.1%, and a risk of pneumothorax of 3.1%. Finally, Zhang et al 61\nincluded 17 studies of ENB with a pooled sensitivity for cancer diagnoses of 82%, a speci fi city of 100%, a positive likelihood ratio of 19.36, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.23. In the present meta-analysis, 40 studies were quantitatively analyzed, including the results of the US cohort for the largest prospective multicenter study, NAVIGATE. 57\nHeterogeneity was high, likely because of a number of factors, including the prevalence of cancer in each study, the average distance between the tip of the sensor and\nN.A. 1\u20444 not applicable; ROSE 1\u20444 rapid on-site examination. See Table 1 legend for expansion of other abbreviation.\n]\nthe center of the nodule, and the number of sampling techniques used in each study. These variables are related to differences in sensitivity across studies. Other variables with nonsigni fi cant statistical differences included fl uoroscopy use, ROSE use, r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), anesthesia type, the time interval in which the study was performed, and average nodule size. Different time intervals had similar pooled sensitivities except for 2015 to 2016.\nThe present analysis also explored the role of the speci fi c navigation software used (superDimension vs others). Different navigation software have described similar sensitivity; however, there was a wide variation in diagnostic de fi nitions. Research on other systems is sparse compared with superDimension; therefore, the conclusion of these analyses is not applicable to other navigation systems. Our data are only applicable for ENB using the superDimension system.\nFigure 3 -Forest plot. Risk of pneumothorax after electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy.

TTNA has a pooled sensitivity for cancer diagnosis of 92.1%, with a trend toward lower sensitivity in lesions < 2 cm and in lesions located in the lower lobes, making this an attractive choice in patients with solitary lung lesions without mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. 6,62 However, the overall rate of complications is 24% to 39%, with a risk of pneumothorax ranging between 19% and 25%, depending on the sampling method used. 63 Alternatively, we found that ENB is a safe procedure with < 3% overall complications. These fi ndings are similar to previously reported ones, with the most common complication being pneumothorax, occurring in approximately 2% of patients. Considering these factors, it can be said that the use of ENB is a safe alternative to TTNA, especially in those patients with an increased risk of complications because of comorbidities.\nOn the other hand, traditional bronchoscopy has shown variable diagnostic accuracy for total diagnoses for PPLs, as shown by the AQuIRE database. 4 r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) has been proposed in the literature as an alternative to increase the diagnostic yield of the previously mentioned technique. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported a pooled sensitivity for cancer diagnosis of 72% for PPLs (95% CI, 70%-75%; I 2 1\u20444 76%), with a pooled risk of pneumothorax of 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.1%). 64 Although sensitivity improved when r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was used, it is dif fi cult to draw conclusions because heterogeneity in the mentioned meta-analysis was high. The addition of other techniques, such as ROSE, endobronchial ultrasound needle aspiration, or fl uoroscopy did not increase diagnostic sensitivity, as seen in previous studies. 65\nENB should be performed with biopsy tools designed to achieve a suf fi cient sample size for analysis. Our data suggest that the use of three biopsy tools may increase sensitivity to 83%. However, whenever more than four biopsy tools were used, sensitivity dropped to 71%. Drawing conclusions based on these data is dif fi cult given the signi fi cant heterogeneity between groups as seen with a positive Q test. A prospective study designed to look at this is necessary to corroborate these fi ndings.\nPrecision medicine requires a comprehensive approach including the determination of driver oncogenes. Studies describe the percentage of adequate samples where these ancillary tests were performed (molecular testing, fl ow cytometry, etc). Pooled data from 610 participants showed that when ENB was used, 90% of samples were\nsuf fi cient for ancillary tests; this proportion is similar to other minimally invasive methods such as endobronchial ultrasound needle aspiration. 66,67 However, only three studies included data about this topic, and future research incorporating data on the ability to achieve a suf fi cient sample for ancillary tests is necessary. At the time of this publication, international guidelines do not recommend the analysis of driver oncogenes in stage I non-small cell lung cancer, and this is likely to impact the number of available cases for analysis.\nThis paper was performed according to current recommendations. In the present meta-analysis, a random effects model was prede fi ned because of high heterogeneity between subgroups. This method is strongly recommended in cases of signi fi cant interstudy heterogeneity. 14 This approach was based on the binomial distribution as the bivariate model, rather than the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model, because the latter model approximates within-study variability of an outcome by a normal distribution, a method that biases diagnostic test results. 10\nWe found the following limitations. First, the presence of an airway sign and distance of the nodule from the pleura were inconsistently reported between different studies; therefore, it was not possible to do subgroup analyses of sensitivity with these variables. Second, we used a trial-level analysis (both subgroup and metaregression analysis) without patient-speci fi c data; therefore, our fi ndings should be viewed as exploratory. 68 Although we found a biological plausibility between studies with both increased prevalence and average nodule size, those variables are strongly associated with an increased pretest probability of positive samples achieved by any bronchoscopic procedure. However, the results of our meta-regression should be interpreted with caution, and further patientlevel data would be necessary to evaluate the potential predictive value of these variables and sensitivity.\nFinally, the fi ndings of this systematic review and metaanalysis should inform future research on minimally invasive procedures after a precision medicine approach. We emphasize the importance of considering the human and technologic capital available at each institution to provide patients with the lowest procedural risk while maintaining an adequate sensitivity for tissue diagnosis. In some cases, the presence of mediastinal involvement or pleural effusion will dictate a different diagnostic strategy or a procedure that can be combined under the same anesthetic episode.\n]\n\n## onclusions\n\nENB is a safe procedure that has good sensitivity for identifying lung cancer, especially in patients with a high pretest probability of malignancy. Signi fi cant limitations\nfor this study include the high heterogeneity in several analyses, despite the explanation of potential causes. Further research is needed to improve the evidence of this diagnostic technique.\n\n## cknowledgments\n\nAuthor contributions: E. E. F. and G.

      "content": "Erik E. Folch, MD; Gonzalo Labarca, MD; Daniel Ospina-Delgado, MD; Fayez Kheir, MD; Adnan Majid, MD; Sandeep J. Khandhar, MD; Hiren J. Mehta, MD; Michael A. Jantz, MD; and Sebastian Fernandez-Bussy, MD\nBACKGROUND: Bronchoscopy is a useful tool for the diagnosis of lesions near central airways; however, the diagnostic accuracy of these procedures for peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) is a matter of ongoing debate. In this setting, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) is a technique used to navigate and obtain samples from these lesions. This systematic review and metaanalysis aims to explore the sensitivity of ENB in patients with PPLs suspected of lung cancer.\nRESEARCH QUESTION: In patients with peripheral pulmonary lesion suspected of lung cancer, what is the sensitivity and safety of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy compared to surgery or longitudinal follow up?\nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of several databases was performed. Extracted data included sensitivity of ENB for malignancy, adequacy of the tissue sample, and complications. The study quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, and the combined data were meta-analyzed using a bivariate method model. A summary receiver operatic characteristic curve (sROC) was created. Finally, the quality of evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.\nRESULTS: Forty studies with a total of 3,342 participants were included in our analysis. ENB reported a pooled sensitivity of 77% (95% CI, 72%-82%; I 2 1\u20444 80.6%) and a speci fi city of 100% (95% CI, 99%-100%; I 2 1\u20444 0%) for malignancy. The sROC showed an area under the curve of 0.955 ( P 1\u20444 .03). ENB achieved a suf fi cient sample for ancillary tests in 90.9% (95% CI, 84.8%-96.9%; I 2 1\u20444 80.7%). Risk of pneumothorax was 2.0% (95% CI, 1.0-3.0; I 2 1\u20444 45.2%). We found subgroup differences according to the risk of bias and the number of sampling techniques. Meta-regression showed an association between sensitivity and the mean distance of the sensor tip to the center of the nodule, the number of tissue sampling techniques, and the cancer prevalence in the study.\nINTERPRETATION: ENB is very safe with good sensitivity for diagnosing malignancy in patients with PPLs. The applicability of our fi ndings is limited because most studies were done with the superDimension navigation system and heterogeneity was high.\nTRIAL REGISTRY: PROSPERO; No.: CRD42019109449; URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/;\nCHEST 2020; 158(4):1753-1769\nKEY WORDS: electromagnetic navigation; image-guided biopsy; lung cancer\nFOR EDITORIAL COMMENT, SEE PAGE 1312\nABBREVIATIONS: ENB = electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy; FN = false negative; FP = false positive; PPL = peripheral pulmonary lesion; r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) = radial endobronchial ultrasound needle aspiration; ROSE = rapid on-site examination; TN = true negative; TP = true positive; TTNA = transthoracic needle aspiration\nAFFILIATIONS: From the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (Dr Folch), Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; The Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Immunology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Concepcion (Dr Labarca), Concepcion, Chile; the Division of Thoracic Surgery and Interventional Pulmonology (Drs Ospina-Delgado, Kheir, and Majid),\n\nLung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in both men and women globally. 1 Early diagnosis of lung cancer is an important proximate objective to facilitate curative intent. According to current clinical practice guidelines, a minimally invasive approach is strongly recommended for patients with pulmonary nodules or lesions suspected of lung cancer. 2 For lesions proximal to central airways, procedures such as endobronchial ultrasound needle aspiration have a sensitivity of > 90% and a speci fi city of > 95% for diagnosis and mediastinal staging. 2,3 Although evidence regarding suspicious lesions near the central airways is strong, accuracy for peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) suspected of lung cancer is variable. Furthermore, data regarding the accuracy of radial endobronchial ultrasound needle aspiration (r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) is only fair, with the AQuIRe registry reporting a diagnostic yield of 57%. 4 In an attempt to improve the yield, several imageguided biopsy diagnostic tools have been developed in the last decade. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) allows physicians to access PPLs beyond the reach of conventional bronchoscopy through a minimally invasive method, using an image-guided fl exible catheter and a dedicated navigation software system (superDimension [Medtronic], SpiNDrive [Veran], etc). 5 This procedure is an alternative to transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA), a procedure with a sensitivity for detecting malignancy of 92.1%. 6 Despite displaying a good sensitivity for cancer diagnosis, TTNA accounts for pneumothorax rates of 25.3% when core biopsy is performed and 18.8% when fi ne needle aspiration is performed, requiring chest tube placement in up to 11.9% of cases. 7\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the sensitivity and safety of ENB for the sampling of PPLs suspected of lung cancer.",

      "content": "A highly sensitive database search was conducted by a review author (G. L.), without language restriction, using the following databases: PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, LILACS (www.scielo.org), Clinical Trials (ClinicalTrials.gov), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com), Scirus (www.scirus. com/srsapp), ISI Web of Knowledge (www.isiwebofknowledge.com), and Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com). An initial literature search was performed in May 2019 and updated in November 2019. References from the included studies were also manually searched along with the abstracts of potential studies presented in conferences from 2014 through 2019 by the American Thoracic Society, American College of Chest Physicians, European Respiratory Society,\nand American Association for Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology. The full literature search strategy is available in eAppendix 1.\nInclusion Criteria: Criteria for inclusion were as follows: (1) ENB used for diagnosis of PPLs, (2) diagnosis con fi rmed histologically or by close clinical follow-up, and (3) studies that stated a clear reference standard for establishing diagnostic sensitivity. We excluded review papers, letters, or studies in which data to calculate sensitivity for malignancy was insuf fi cient. Studies were selected for inclusion only after both reviewers assessed the full text.\nSelection of Studies: The references identi fi ed after the literature search were included in Covidence software (Veritas Health Innovation Ltd). A highly speci fi c hand search screening of both titles and abstracts was independently performed by two review authors (G. L. and D. O.-D.). Eligible studies were evaluated in full text and selected according to our prespeci fi ed inclusion and exclusion criteria; any disagreement was resolved by discussion.\nData Extraction and Quality Assessment: Two independent reviewers (G. L. and D. O.-D.) extracted data from each study. The following information was collected: fi rst author, publication year, publication type (retrospective or prospective), number of participants, index test, reference standard, number of techniques, true positives (TPs), false positives (FPs), true negatives (TNs), false negatives (FNs), use of rapid on-site examination (ROSE) (yes or no), nodule size, fl uoroscopy use (yes or no), r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) use (yes or no), cancer prevalence, and successful navigation to the target lesion. Cancer prevalence was de fi ned as the total lung cancer cases (TPs \u00fe FNs) divided by the total population included in each study. Successful navigation was de fi ned as the number of lesions in which navigation was successful divided by the number of lesions in which navigation was attempted.\nQuality assessment was performed using the QUADAS-2 tool 9 by two reviewers (G. L. and D. O.-D.). We rated the risk of bias because of\nBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; the Virginia Cancer Specialists (Dr Khandhar), Inova Health, Fairfax, VA; the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr Mehta and Jantz), University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; and the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Mayo Clinic (Dr Fernandez-Bussy), Jacksonville, FL.\nFUNDING/SUPPORT: The authors have reported to CHEST that no funding was received for this study.\nCORRESPONDENCE TO: Erik E.

Finally, we rated the overall risk of bias and categorized it as low risk or high risk according to the results of the QUADAS-2 analysis. Any disagreement was resolved by a third reviewer (F. K.).\nData Analysis: Pooled data were analyzed and imported in a two-bytwo contingency table. The principle outcome was de fi ned as the pooled sensitivity of ENB for malignancy (lung cancer). Sensitivity was calculated as TP/TP \u00fe FN, including the total navigation cases (successful and nonsuccessful navigation). Speci fi city (TN/TN \u00fe FP), negative likelihood ratio, and positive likelihood ratio were also reported. For quantitative analyses, we performed a proportions meta-analysis after a binomial distribution. 10 We used the metaprop command with a Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation on STATA software version 14.2 (Stata Corp) 11 and Open Meta Analyst software (Brown University). 12 We also created a summary receiver operatic characteristic curve. 10,13 All results were expressed as a percentage and a 95% CI with an alpha value of 0.05.\nInterstudy heterogeneity (percentage of total variation across studies that is caused by heterogeneity rather than chance) was measured using visual inspection of a forest plot and an I 2 test. Signi fi cant heterogeneity was de fi ned as an I 2 > 75% and nonsigni fi cant was de fi ned as I 2 < 40% according to previous publications. 14 In the case of signi fi cant heterogeneity, subgroup analysis evaluating possible explanations of the difference between groups was explored. 15 We prespeci fi ed the following variables as potential subgroups: (1) risk of bias of included studies, (2) type of navigation system used (superDimension or others), (3) use of ROSE, (4) use of fl uoroscopy guidance, (5) type of anesthesia (general, conscious sedation, or both), (6) r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) use, (7) time interval in which the study was performed, and (8) number of sampling techniques used in association to ENB. Finally, heterogeneity between subgroups was assessed with a Q test.\nThe potential for publication bias was evaluated through both visual inspection of the funnel plot and Egger test. Asymmetry in the distribution of the studies in the funnel plot raised concerns about serious publication bias. 16\nComplementary Analysis: Adequacy of the Sample Achieved by ENB and Association Between Sensitivity and Covariables: A random effects model was used in cases in which heterogeneity between studies was high. A fi xed random effects model was used in cases in which this heterogeneity was low. For overall sensitivity, both models were used, and results were compared. We performed two complementary data analyses. For the fi rst analysis, we explored the association between pooled sensitivity for the diagnosis of malignancy and continuous variables related to ENB procedure through a metaregression. The dependent variable was de fi ned as the pooled sensitivity for lung cancer. We used the following independent continuous covariables related to ENB procedures to run the model: cancer prevalence, distance between tip of sensor and center of nodule, duration of the procedure, number of sampling techniques used in association to ENB, and nodule size. 17 For the second complementary analysis, we explored the adequacy of samples obtained through ENB to test for driver oncogenes. In this case, we performed a binary effect meta-analysis after a maximum likelihood method. A suf fi cient sample was de fi ned as a sample obtained using ENB that allowed the performance of the ancillary test. For calculation, we used the proportion of participants in which a suf fi cient sample was achieved relative to all participants in which a sample for ancillary testing was attempted as an effect measure.\nSafety Analysis: Additionally, we reviewed the safety of ENB by assessing the proportion of patients that developed the following adverse events: (1) pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement; (2) minor bronchopulmonary bleeding, de fi ned as bleeding that stopped spontaneously in < 5 min or with the use of a Fogarty balloon; (3) major bronchopulmonary bleeding, de fi ned as bleeding that did not meet minor bleeding criteria; (4) acute respiratory failure; and (5) need for a repeat biopsy.\nThe effect measure used was the proportion of participants who developed the adverse event relative to all the participants included in each study.\nFinally, we created a summary of fi ndings table of the diagnostic test results, 18 and the quality of evidence was rated by a panel (G. L. and F. K.) following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.",

Wang Memoli et al 59 quantitatively analyzed 39 studies (prior to 2010) that described alternative PPL exploration techniques (r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), ENB, etc). The authors reported a diagnostic yield for any diagnoses of 70%, with a pneumothorax rate of 1.5%. 59 A study by Gex et al 60 described the diagnostic accuracy for any diagnoses of ENB including 15 trials with an overall accuracy of 73.9%, a sensitivity of 71.1%, and a risk of pneumothorax of 3.1%. Finally, Zhang et al 61\nincluded 17 studies of ENB with a pooled sensitivity for cancer diagnoses of 82%, a speci fi city of 100%, a positive likelihood ratio of 19.36, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.23. In the present meta-analysis, 40 studies were quantitatively analyzed, including the results of the US cohort for the largest prospective multicenter study, NAVIGATE. 57\nHeterogeneity was high, likely because of a number of factors, including the prevalence of cancer in each study, the average distance between the tip of the sensor and\nN.A. 1\u20444 not applicable; ROSE 1\u20444 rapid on-site examination. See Table 1 legend for expansion of other abbreviation.\n]\nthe center of the nodule, and the number of sampling techniques used in each study. These variables are related to differences in sensitivity across studies. Other variables with nonsigni fi cant statistical differences included fl uoroscopy use, ROSE use, r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), anesthesia type, the time interval in which the study was performed, and average nodule size. Different time intervals had similar pooled sensitivities except for 2015 to 2016.\nThe present analysis also explored the role of the speci fi c navigation software used (superDimension vs others). Different navigation software have described similar sensitivity; however, there was a wide variation in diagnostic de fi nitions. Research on other systems is sparse compared with superDimension; therefore, the conclusion of these analyses is not applicable to other navigation systems. Our data are only applicable for ENB using the superDimension system.\nFigure 3 -Forest plot. Risk of pneumothorax after electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy. PPL 1\u20444 peripheral pulmonary lesion. See Figure 2 legend for expansion of other abbreviation.\nCompared with other methods, TTNA has historically been the preferred diagnostic method to explore PPLs to avoid unnecessary surgery. TTNA has a pooled sensitivity for cancer diagnosis of 92.1%, with a trend toward lower sensitivity in lesions < 2 cm and in lesions located in the lower lobes, making this an attractive choice in patients with solitary lung lesions without mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. 6,62 However, the overall rate of complications is 24% to 39%, with a risk of pneumothorax ranging between 19% and 25%, depending on the sampling method used. 63 Alternatively, we found that ENB is a safe procedure with < 3% overall complications. These fi ndings are similar to previously reported ones, with the most common complication being pneumothorax, occurring in approximately 2% of patients. Considering these factors, it can be said that the use of ENB is a safe alternative to TTNA, especially in those patients with an increased risk of complications because of comorbidities.\nOn the other hand, traditional bronchoscopy has shown variable diagnostic accuracy for total diagnoses for PPLs, as shown by the AQuIRE database. 4 r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) has been proposed in the literature as an alternative to increase the diagnostic yield of the previously mentioned technique. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported a pooled sensitivity for cancer diagnosis of 72% for PPLs (95% CI, 70%-75%; I 2 1\u20444 76%), with a pooled risk of pneumothorax of 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.1%). 64 Although sensitivity improved when r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was used, it is dif fi cult to draw conclusions because heterogeneity in the mentioned meta-analysis was high. The addition of other techniques, such as ROSE, endobronchial ultrasound needle aspiration, or fl uoroscopy did not increase diagnostic sensitivity, as seen in previous studies. 65\nENB should be performed with biopsy tools designed to achieve a suf fi cient sample size for analysis. Our data suggest that the use of three biopsy tools may increase sensitivity to 83%. However, whenever more than four biopsy tools were used, sensitivity dropped to 71%. Drawing conclusions based on these data is dif fi cult given the signi fi cant heterogeneity between groups as seen with a positive Q test. A prospective study designed to look at this is necessary to corroborate these fi ndings.\nPrecision medicine requires a comprehensive approach including the determination of driver oncogenes. Studies describe the percentage of adequate samples where these ancillary tests were performed (molecular testing, fl ow cytometry, etc). Pooled data from 610 participants showed that when ENB was used, 90% of samples were\nsuf fi cient for ancillary tests; this proportion is similar to other minimally invasive methods such as endobronchial ultrasound needle aspiration. 66,67 However, only three studies included data about this topic, and future research incorporating data on the ability to achieve a suf fi cient sample for ancillary tests is necessary. At the time of this publication, international guidelines do not recommend the analysis of driver oncogenes in stage I non-small cell lung cancer, and this is likely to impact the number of available cases for analysis.\nThis paper was performed according to current recommendations. In the present meta-analysis, a random effects model was prede fi ned because of high heterogeneity between subgroups. This method is strongly recommended in cases of signi fi cant interstudy heterogeneity. 14 This approach was based on the binomial distribution as the bivariate model, rather than the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model, because the latter model approximates within-study variability of an outcome by a normal distribution, a method that biases diagnostic test results. 10\nWe found the following limitations. First, the presence of an airway sign and distance of the nodule from the pleura were inconsistently reported between different studies; therefore, it was not possible to do subgroup analyses of sensitivity with these variables. Second, we used a trial-level analysis (both subgroup and metaregression analysis) without patient-speci fi c data; therefore, our fi ndings should be viewed as exploratory. 68 Although we found a biological plausibility between studies with both increased prevalence and average nodule size, those variables are strongly associated with an increased pretest probability of positive samples achieved by any bronchoscopic procedure. However, the results of our meta-regression should be interpreted with caution, and further patientlevel data would be necessary to evaluate the potential predictive value of these variables and sensitivity.\nFinally, the fi ndings of this systematic review and metaanalysis should inform future research on minimally invasive procedures after a precision medicine approach. We emphasize the importance of considering the human and technologic capital available at each institution to provide patients with the lowest procedural risk while maintaining an adequate sensitivity for tissue diagnosis. In some cases, the presence of mediastinal involvement or pleural effusion will dictate a different diagnostic strategy or a procedure that can be combined under the same anesthetic episode.\n]",
