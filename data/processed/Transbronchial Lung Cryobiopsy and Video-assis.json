DPLDs differ widely in their etiology, clinicopathologic features, therapeutic options, and prognosis (1). International\nconsensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) (2, 3) indicate that in approximately 50% of cases, chest highresolution computed tomography may not be suf fi cient to diagnose idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis (IPF), and surgical lung biopsy is recommended to\ndistinguish usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) from other ILDs (4). Although transbronchial lung forceps biopsy is not currently recommended to histologically con fi rm UIP, due to its low diagnostic yield (2, 5), surgical lung biopsy, whether video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or open-lung biopsy (OLB), is\nburdened by its associated risks, postoperative complications, and prolonged hospitalization.\nTransbronchial lung cryobiopsy is increasingly being used for the assessment of DPLDs. The major advantage of this procedure is that larger tissue samples with a higher percentage of alveolar tissue can be obtained with fewer crush artifacts and less atelectasis (6 -8). The cryosurgical equipment operates by the Joule -Thompson effect (9), which dictates that a compressed gas released at high fl ow rapidly expands and creates a very low temperature. The cooling agent (carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide) is applied under high pressure through the central canal of the probe. The gas at the tip suddenly expands due to difference in pressure (relative to atmospheric pressure), causing a drop in temperature at the tip of the probe (in the tissue of approximately 2 50 8 C to 2 60 8 C). The probe is cooled for approximately 3 to 6 seconds (larger probe cooled for 7 -8 s). The frozen tissue attached to the probe ' s tip is removed by pulling the cryoprobe together with the bronchoscope. The frozen specimen is then thawed in physiological saline and fi xed in formalin.\nSeveral meta-analyses (5, 10 -12) have evaluated the diagnostic yield and safety of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy. The pooled diagnostic yield in the metaanalyses by Sharp and colleagues (5), Johannson and colleagues (11), and Ravaglia and colleagues (12) was reported to be 84% (75.9 -91.4% on the basis of 11 studies and abstracts), 83% (73 -94% on the basis of 11 studies), and 81% (75 -87% on the basis of 12 studies and abstracts), respectively. The meta-analysis by Ganganah and colleagues (10) on the basis of two studies reported an 85% diagnostic yield. Although the pooled incidence of post-procedure pneumothorax reported in these meta-analyses (5, 10 -12) was similar (6 -12%), the incidence of moderate to severe bleeding differed widely (12 -39%). In this ' diagnostic test accuracy ' metaanalysis, we sought to not only update the pooled diagnostic yield from all published studies in the literature but also report on other diagnostic test accuracy measures (pooled sensitivity, speci fi city, diagnostic odds ratio, and summary receiver operative curve [SROC]) as well as the safety pro fi le of transbronchial lung\ncryobiopsy and compare these with studies on VATS.\n\n## iterature Search and Study Selection\n\nA systematic search of the literature was performed in December 2016 to identify all studies that reported information on the diagnostic yield of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and VATS in the diagnosis of diffuse parenchymal lung disease. We searched Medline and PubMed using the search strategy displayed in Figure 1. Full text articles of shortlisted abstracts were independently assessed by the two authors (I.H.I. and L.A) for inclusion in this metaanalysis. Disagreement on any study selection was resolved by independent review of a third author (A.M). Excluded from selection were review articles, non -peer-reviewed papers, and conference proceedings. Quality of included studies was assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool, consisting of four key domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard,\nand the fl ow and timing ( see data supplement).\n\n## ata Extraction\n\nExtracted data included the following items: type of study, description of study population (age and sex distribution), site and number of biopsies, fi nal histopathological diagnosis, and data on diagnostic performance. The latter were abstracted by constructing two-by-two contingency tables for each study, with patients categorized into one of four options: true positive (TP), false positive (FP), false negative (FN), and true negative (TN). The primary outcome was diagnostic yield. Success with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy or VATS (TP) was de fi ned as a de fi nitive diagnosis that was yielded by biopsy. When the benign diagnosis was initially yielded by biopsy from either procedure and con fi rmed by clinical and radiological consensus, it was also considered as a success (TN). Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy/VATS failure represented a biopsy that was either nondiagnostic or yielded a\n(Continued)\n(Continued)\n(Continued)\nbenign diagnosis that was overturned when a follow-up diagnostic procedure (VATS or OLB after an initial lung cryobiopsy or OLB after an initial VATS) was performed (FN). We also included data on a priori selected safety outcomes, speci fi cally,\nincidence of endobronchial bleeding, pneumothorax, and 30- to 60-day mortality post transbronchial lung cryobiopsy, and incidence of prolonged air leak (de fi ned as air leak lasting for > 4 d post VATS), as well as the 30- to 60-day mortality post VATS.\n\n## tatistical Analysis\n\nExtracted data were pooled with weighted averages using a random effects model. The weight of each study was proportionate to its sample size. Comprehensive MetaAnalysis (CMA) version 2.2.064 software was used to compute the pooled diagnostic\nDefinition of abbreviations : AIP = acute interstitial pneumonitis; BO = bronchiolitis obliterans; BOOP = bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia;\nCB=constrictive bronchiolitis; COP = cryptogenic organizing pneumonia; CTD = connective tissue disease related; DAD = diffuse alveolar damage;\nDIP = desquamative interstitial pneumonia; FB = follicular bronchiolitis; HP = hypersensitivity pneumonitis; ILD = lung disease; IPF = idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis;\nLAM=lymphangioleiomyomatosis; LH = Langerhan's histiocytosis; LIP = lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia; N/A = data not available; NSIP = nonspecific\ninterstitial pneumonia; OP = organizing pneumonia; p-ANCA = perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies; PAP = pulmonary alveolar proteinosis;\nPCP=\nPneumocystis\npneumonia; PLCH = pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis; RBILD = respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease; SAR = sarcoidosis;\nUIP = usual interstitial pneumonia.\n*Data presented as mean (SD or range).\nyield. Meta-DiSc version 1.4 was used to pool the data on sensitivity and speci fi city for each data set, and the results were presented by constructing forest plots. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically signi fi cant. Diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) were also computed, but, as no diagnostic threshold exists for histological diagnoses, regression of the log DOR on the measure of diagnostic threshold was not applicable to this metaanalysis.\nMathematically, the DOR was de fi ned\nas:\nMeta-DiSc was also used to construct SROCs, as described by Moses and colleagues (13). From the SROC, the area under the curve with SE was also calculated. Heterogeneity was assessed with I 2 index.\nData on safety pro fi le were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 2.2.064 software.\n\n## esults\n\nThe study selection process is shown in Figure 1. A total of 16 studies (6 -8, 12,\n14 -25) for transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and 14 studies (26 -39) for VATS were included in the metaanalyses of diagnostic test accuracy. This meta-analysis analyzed data from a total of 2,533 patients who underwent transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (N = 642) and VATS (N = 1,594). Table 1 lists the demographics of the study population and the fi nal histopathologic diagnosis.\n\n## est Performance\n\nData for analysis of pooled diagnostic yield were available for 16 of 16 of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy studies (6 -8, 12, 14 -25) and 14 of 14 VATS studies (26 -39). The pooled diagnostic yields for transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and VATS were 83.7% (76.9 -88.8%; I 2 , 86%) and 92.7% (87.6 -95.8%; I 2 , 85%), respectively (Figures 2 and 3).\n\n## ensitivity and Speci fi city\n\nOnly 14 (6 -8, 14 -24) out of the total 16 transbronchial lung cryobiopsy studies had data that allowed for computation of pooled sensitivity, speci fi city, DORs, and SROC. All of the included VATS studies\nwere analyzed for pooled sensitivity, speci fi city, DORs, and SROC.\nPooled sensitivity and speci fi city of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy were 87% (85 -89%; I 2 , 94%) and 57% (40 -73%; I 2 , 0%), respectively. Pooled sensitivity and speci fi city of VATS were 91% (89 -92%; I 2 , 91%) and 58% (31 -81%; I 2 , 0%), respectively.\n\n## iagnostic Odds Ratio\n\nDiagnostic odds ratio for transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and VATS were 25.53 (8.92 -73.04) and 21.06 (7.08 -62.60), respectively (Figures 4 and 5).\n\n## ROC\n\nSROC from the data on transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and VATS was calculated as 0.85 (SE = 0.07) and 0.74 (SE = 0.12), respectively (Figures 6 and 7).\n\n## afety Outcomes\n\nSafety outcomes are tabulated in Tables 2 and 3. The incidence of grade 2 (moderate to severe) endobronchial bleeding requiring bronchoscopic intervention reported in 16 studies (6 -8, 14 -25) (where these data were available) after transbronchial lung\ncryobiopsy was 4.9% (2.2 -10.7%), as shown in Figure 8. Only four studies (8, 18, 19, 21) reported high incidence (Table 2). The incidence of pneumothorax reported in 13 studies (6 -8, 12, 14 -25)\nwas 9.5% (5.9 -14.9%), as shown in Figure 9. Only fi ve studies (15, 18, 19, 23, 25) reported high incidence (Table 2). Most studies on VATS did not report data on the incidence of\nprolonged air leak (Table 3). In the fi ve studies (29, 32, 33, 35, 36) that reported these data, the incidence was 2% (0.9 -4%), as shown in Figure 10. Figure 11 compares the incidence of 30- to 60-day\nDiagnostic Odds ratio (OR) (95% CI)\nmortality after both procedures: 0.7% (0.4 -1.2%) after transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and 1.8% (1.0 -3%) after VATS. Only three studies (12, 15, 25) reported mortality after transbronchial lung cryobiopsy, which was believed to be secondary to acute exacerbation of IPF presumably resulting from\nprocedural complications. The incidence of 30- to 60-day mortality after VATS was 1.8%. This was either due to acute respiratory failure (35, 39), pulmonary embolism (39), acute exacerbation of pulmonary fi brosis (32, 39), pulmonary infection (39), sepsis (33), or unknown (30).\n\n## iscussion\n\nWith a 4.9% (2.2 -10.7%) incidence of grade 2 endobronchial bleeding and 9.5% (5.9 -14.9%) incidence of pneumothorax after transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (Figures 8 and 9), 0.7% 30- to 60-day mortality post lung cryobiopsy compared with 1.8% with VATS (Figure 11), reported median hospitalization time of 2.6 days compared with the 6.1 days with VATS ( P , 0.0001), and diagnostic test accuracy approaching that of VATS, transbronchial lung cryobiopsy should be considered an alternative to surgical lung biopsy (OLB or VATS) or attempted fi rst in patients with DPLDs, elderly patients, and those with signi fi cant comorbidities. The incidence of post-procedure pneumothorax in our metaanalysis is higher than that reported for the conventional transbronchial forceps biopsy (6% [3.2 -9.6%]) (5).\nHowever, the increased diagnostic yield (84% with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy vs. 64% with conventional forceps biopsy) and the increased sample size provided by transbronchial lung cryobiopsy need to be considered in clinical practice. The diagnostic yield of 84% with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy is comparatively less than the 92.7% diagnostic yield with VATS, as shown in our meta-analysis. With a sensitivity of 87% and speci fi city of 57%, transbronchial\nDiagnostic Odds ratio (OR) (95% CI)\nlung cryobiopsy lags somewhat behind VATS, which has a relatively higher sensitivity and speci fi city (91% and 58%, respectively). Variable diagnostic yield with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy in different studies could partially be explained by the size of the cryoprobes:\n70 to 95% with a 2.4-mm probe (6, 8, 14, 15, 18, 21) and 79 to 80% with a 1.9-mm probe (17, 19, 20).\nFurthermore, optimal tissue yield can also be affected by several factors: number of biopsies, short versus long freeze time, operating room versus bronchoscopy area,\nmethod of sedation (moderate sedation vs. a deeply sedated patient), method of bronchoscopy ( fl exible vs. rigid), and measures to treat complications such as hemoptysis (prophylactically using Fogarty balloon). The use of general anesthesia could theoretically reduce the risk of iatrogenic complications (less patient movement and coughing) and improve tissue yield. However, transbronchial lung cryobiopsy under moderate sedation (with preservation of spontaneous breathing) has been shown to perform just as well, with a lower risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax than transbronchial lung cryobiopsy under general anesthesia (18). Although an increased number of cryoprobe biopsies would theoretically improve the diagnostic yield, it could also lead to more bleeding and pneumothorax complications (18). Typically, two to four biopsies are considered suf fi cient for pathological examination. Our meta-analysis also shows a trend for 2.4-mm size cryoprobe to be associated with signi fi cant pneumothorax rate (12, 18, 23, 25). Although the use of fl exible versus rigid bronchoscopy and choice of moderate versus deep sedation are dependent on the comfort level of the bronchoscopist, we recommend, at the very least, to have a bronchial blocker in place and the\nDefinition of abbreviation : N/A = data not available.\nbronchoscopy room equipped with ultrasound and emergency chest tube equipment, to be prepared for any potential immediate complications post procedure.\nAlthough baseline FVC affects the suitability of the candidate for surgical lung biopsy and predicts the risk of adverse events postsurgery (40, 41), complications\nafter transbronchial lung cryobiopsy seem to occur independent of lung function values (12). Median time of hospitalization after surgical lung biopsy for any cause is between 4 and 8 days, elderly patients being at higher risk for prolonged hospitalization (42, 43). Prolonged hospitalization along with operating room time, anesthesia time, and professional\ncharges of different disciplinary teams increase the associated costs with VATS or any surgical lung biopsy. According to a recent cost-effective analysis conducted in Spain by Hern \u0301 andez-Gonz \u0301 alez and colleagues (19), cryobiopsies have the potential to save about \u20ac 31,451.97 ( \u20ac 953.09/patient) for outpatient surgical lung biopsy\nFigure 8. Endobronchial bleeding with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy. The size of the circle indicates the weight of the effect size as determined by the number of studies and participants. The diamond indicates the pooled effect. CI = confidence interval.\nprocedures and \u20ac 59,846.29 ( \u20ac 1925.29/ patient) for surgical lung biopsies requiring hospitalization. Similarly, on the basis of a theoretical cost analysis, Sharp and colleagues (5) report that transbronchial lung cryobiopsy has the potential to save \u00a3210 per patient in the fi rst year and \u00a3647 in subsequent years.\nThe yield of lung parenchyma resulting in clinically useful histopathological\ndiagnoses from conventional transbronchial biopsy specimens is on the order of 38% (44), and the yield of nonspeci fi c in fl ammation and fi brosis varies from 21 to 48% (45). Thus, conventional transbronchial biopsy does not compare well with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy, which has a speci fi city of 57% for DPLDs. In a cross-sectional study of 117 patients with UIP on high-resolution computed tomography, where half of the patients\nunderwent either transbronchial lung cryobiopsy or surgical lung biopsy, Tomassetti and colleagues (25) observed that the proportion of IPF cases diagnosed with a high degree of con fi dence increased from 16 to 63% after adding cryobiopsy in the process. Pathologists experienced in cryobiopsy analysis had an agreement nearly equivalent to surgical lung biopsy (0.73 for cryobiopsy vs. 0.86 for surgical lung biopsy), and the diagnoses obtained by multidisciplinary team discussion were similarly distributed in the two groups (transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and surgical lung biopsy) (25). The current gold standard for the diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases, when surgical lung biopsy is incorporated into a multidisciplinary discussion, is limited by modest interobserver agreement by expert pathologists: ' moderate to good ' agreement for those interpreting ILD patterns, ' good ' agreement for IPF and connective tissue disease -related ILD, ' moderate ' agreement for nonspeci fi c interstitial pneumonia, and ' fair ' agreement for hypersensitivity pneumonitis (46).\nOur meta-analysis con fi rms the results of prior meta-analyses (5, 10 -12) that reported a pooled diagnostic yield of 81 to 85% for transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and 91 to 98% for VATS. However, there are important differences between ours and prior meta-analyses (5, 10 -12). Unlike our meta-analysis, none of the prior meta-analyses (5, 10 -12) analyzed other measures of diagnostic test accuracy (pooled sensitivity, speci fi city, diagnostic odds ratio, and SROC). Our meta-analysis excluded data from abstracts and conference proceedings, which were included in the pooled analyses by others (5, 12). Although the pooled incidence of post-procedural pneumothorax in our study (9.5% [5.9 -14.9%]) is similar to what has been previously reported, that of\nmoderate to severe bleeding differs greatly from a few (5, 10, 11). On the latter, our results are in contrast, probably because ours is a pooled data set from 16 studies, whereas, for example, Johannson and colleagues ' (11) is from 4 studies, Sharp and colleagues ' (5) is from 11 studies (including an abstract), Ravaglia and colleagues ' (12) is from 12 studies (including abstracts), and Ganganah and colleagues ' (10) is only from 3 studies.\n\n## imitations\n\nOur meta-analysis has a few limitations. We did not construct funnel plots for assessing publication bias. This was decided a priori on the basis of the evidence that the unique features of a meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy\ndo not allow for the application of Begg, Egger, and Macaskill tests of funnel plot asymmetry and can be potentially misleading (47, 48). Estimates of sensitivity and diagnostic yield showed high heterogeneity, and the design of this meta-analysis limited us in exploring potential sources of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity can be explained by technical/procedural differences between bronchoscopists and selection bias in studies. Moreover, the reported endobronchial bleeding could have been underreported in different studies.\n\n## onclusions\n\nIn conclusion, our meta-analysis demonstrates that in the evaluation of DPLDs, the diagnostic performance of\ntransbronchial lung cryobiopsy is comparable to that of VATS. However, the risk of potential procedural complications, such as pneumothorax and moderate to severe bleeding, need to be weighed in when\nconsidering this procedure. Further research with head-to-head comparisons of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and VATS or OLB, the current gold standard for surgically obtained lung tissue, is warranted to compare\nthe diagnostic accuracy of both procedures in the evaluation of DPLD. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.\n\n## eferences\n\n1 Maher TM.

      "content": "Rationale: Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy is increasingly being used for the assessment of diffuse parenchymal lung diseases. Several studies have shown larger biopsy samples and higher yields compared with conventional transbronchial biopsies. However, the higher risk of bleeding and other complications has raised concerns for widespread use of this modality.\nObjectives: To study the diagnostic accuracy and safety pro fi le of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and compare with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) by reviewing available evidence from the literature.\nMethods: Medline and PubMed were searched from inception until December 2016. Data on diagnostic performance were abstracted by constructing two-by-two contingency tables for each study. Data on a priori selected safety outcomes were collected. Risk of bias was assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Random effects meta-analyses\nwere performed to obtain summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy.\nResults: The pooled diagnostic yield, pooled sensitivity, and pooled speci fi city of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy were 83.7% (76.9 -88.8%), 87%(85 -89%),and57%(40 -73%),respectively. Thepooled diagnostic yield, pooled sensitivity, and pooled speci fi city of VATS were 92.7% (87.6 -95.8%), 91.0% (89 -92%), and 58% (31 -81%), respectively. The incidence of grade 2 (moderate to severe) endobronchial bleeding after transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and of post-procedural pneumothorax was 4.9% (2.2 -10.7%) and 9.5% (5.9 -14.9%), respectively.\nConclusions: Although the diagnostic test accuracy measures of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy lag behind those of VATS, with an acceptable safety pro fi le and potential cost savings, the former could be considered as an alternative in the evaluation of patients with diffuse parenchymal lung diseases.\nKeywords: meta-analysis; diffuse parenchymal lung diseases; cryobiopsy; video-assisted thoracoscopy\n(Received in original form January 29, 2017; accepted in final form April 11, 2017)\nAuthor Contributions : I.H.I. conceptualized the study, extracted and analyzed data, and wrote the first draft.

DPLDs differ widely in their etiology, clinicopathologic features, therapeutic options, and prognosis (1). International\nconsensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) (2, 3) indicate that in approximately 50% of cases, chest highresolution computed tomography may not be suf fi cient to diagnose idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis (IPF), and surgical lung biopsy is recommended to\ndistinguish usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) from other ILDs (4). Although transbronchial lung forceps biopsy is not currently recommended to histologically con fi rm UIP, due to its low diagnostic yield (2, 5), surgical lung biopsy, whether video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or open-lung biopsy (OLB), is\nburdened by its associated risks, postoperative complications, and prolonged hospitalization.\nTransbronchial lung cryobiopsy is increasingly being used for the assessment of DPLDs. The major advantage of this procedure is that larger tissue samples with a higher percentage of alveolar tissue can be obtained with fewer crush artifacts and less atelectasis (6 -8). The cryosurgical equipment operates by the Joule -Thompson effect (9), which dictates that a compressed gas released at high fl ow rapidly expands and creates a very low temperature. The cooling agent (carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide) is applied under high pressure through the central canal of the probe. The gas at the tip suddenly expands due to difference in pressure (relative to atmospheric pressure), causing a drop in temperature at the tip of the probe (in the tissue of approximately 2 50 8 C to 2 60 8 C). The probe is cooled for approximately 3 to 6 seconds (larger probe cooled for 7 -8 s). The frozen tissue attached to the probe ' s tip is removed by pulling the cryoprobe together with the bronchoscope. The frozen specimen is then thawed in physiological saline and fi xed in formalin.\nSeveral meta-analyses (5, 10 -12) have evaluated the diagnostic yield and safety of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy. The pooled diagnostic yield in the metaanalyses by Sharp and colleagues (5), Johannson and colleagues (11), and Ravaglia and colleagues (12) was reported to be 84% (75.9 -91.4% on the basis of 11 studies and abstracts), 83% (73 -94% on the basis of 11 studies), and 81% (75 -87% on the basis of 12 studies and abstracts), respectively. The meta-analysis by Ganganah and colleagues (10) on the basis of two studies reported an 85% diagnostic yield. Although the pooled incidence of post-procedure pneumothorax reported in these meta-analyses (5, 10 -12) was similar (6 -12%), the incidence of moderate to severe bleeding differed widely (12 -39%). In this ' diagnostic test accuracy ' metaanalysis, we sought to not only update the pooled diagnostic yield from all published studies in the literature but also report on other diagnostic test accuracy measures (pooled sensitivity, speci fi city, diagnostic odds ratio, and summary receiver operative curve [SROC]) as well as the safety pro fi le of transbronchial lung\ncryobiopsy and compare these with studies on VATS.",

Full text articles of shortlisted abstracts were independently assessed by the two authors (I.H.I. and L.A) for inclusion in this metaanalysis. Disagreement on any study selection was resolved by independent review of a third author (A.M). Excluded from selection were review articles, non -peer-reviewed papers, and conference proceedings.

      "content": "With a 4.9% (2.2 -10.7%) incidence of grade 2 endobronchial bleeding and 9.5% (5.9 -14.9%) incidence of pneumothorax after transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (Figures 8 and 9), 0.7% 30- to 60-day mortality post lung cryobiopsy compared with 1.8% with VATS (Figure 11), reported median hospitalization time of 2.6 days compared with the 6.1 days with VATS ( P , 0.0001), and diagnostic test accuracy approaching that of VATS, transbronchial lung cryobiopsy should be considered an alternative to surgical lung biopsy (OLB or VATS) or attempted fi rst in patients with DPLDs, elderly patients, and those with signi fi cant comorbidities. The incidence of post-procedure pneumothorax in our metaanalysis is higher than that reported for the conventional transbronchial forceps biopsy (6% [3.2 -9.6%]) (5).\nHowever, the increased diagnostic yield (84% with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy vs. 64% with conventional forceps biopsy) and the increased sample size provided by transbronchial lung cryobiopsy need to be considered in clinical practice. The diagnostic yield of 84% with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy is comparatively less than the 92.7% diagnostic yield with VATS, as shown in our meta-analysis. With a sensitivity of 87% and speci fi city of 57%, transbronchial\nDiagnostic Odds ratio (OR) (95% CI)\nlung cryobiopsy lags somewhat behind VATS, which has a relatively higher sensitivity and speci fi city (91% and 58%, respectively). Variable diagnostic yield with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy in different studies could partially be explained by the size of the cryoprobes:\n70 to 95% with a 2.4-mm probe (6, 8, 14, 15, 18, 21) and 79 to 80% with a 1.9-mm probe (17, 19, 20).\nFurthermore, optimal tissue yield can also be affected by several factors: number of biopsies, short versus long freeze time, operating room versus bronchoscopy area,\nmethod of sedation (moderate sedation vs. a deeply sedated patient), method of bronchoscopy ( fl exible vs. rigid), and measures to treat complications such as hemoptysis (prophylactically using Fogarty balloon). The use of general anesthesia could theoretically reduce the risk of iatrogenic complications (less patient movement and coughing) and improve tissue yield. However, transbronchial lung cryobiopsy under moderate sedation (with preservation of spontaneous breathing) has been shown to perform just as well, with a lower risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax than transbronchial lung cryobiopsy under general anesthesia (18). Although an increased number of cryoprobe biopsies would theoretically improve the diagnostic yield, it could also lead to more bleeding and pneumothorax complications (18). Typically, two to four biopsies are considered suf fi cient for pathological examination. Our meta-analysis also shows a trend for 2.4-mm size cryoprobe to be associated with signi fi cant pneumothorax rate (12, 18, 23, 25). Although the use of fl exible versus rigid bronchoscopy and choice of moderate versus deep sedation are dependent on the comfort level of the bronchoscopist, we recommend, at the very least, to have a bronchial blocker in place and the\nDefinition of abbreviation : N/A = data not available.\nbronchoscopy room equipped with ultrasound and emergency chest tube equipment, to be prepared for any potential immediate complications post procedure.\nAlthough baseline FVC affects the suitability of the candidate for surgical lung biopsy and predicts the risk of adverse events postsurgery (40, 41), complications\nafter transbronchial lung cryobiopsy seem to occur independent of lung function values (12). Median time of hospitalization after surgical lung biopsy for any cause is between 4 and 8 days, elderly patients being at higher risk for prolonged hospitalization (42, 43). Prolonged hospitalization along with operating room time, anesthesia time, and professional\ncharges of different disciplinary teams increase the associated costs with VATS or any surgical lung biopsy. According to a recent cost-effective analysis conducted in Spain by Hern \u0301 andez-Gonz \u0301 alez and colleagues (19), cryobiopsies have the potential to save about \u20ac 31,451.97 ( \u20ac 953.09/patient) for outpatient surgical lung biopsy\nFigure 8. Endobronchial bleeding with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy. The size of the circle indicates the weight of the effect size as determined by the number of studies and participants. The diamond indicates the pooled effect. CI = confidence interval.\nprocedures and \u20ac 59,846.29 ( \u20ac 1925.29/ patient) for surgical lung biopsies requiring hospitalization. Similarly, on the basis of a theoretical cost analysis, Sharp and colleagues (5) report that transbronchial lung cryobiopsy has the potential to save \u00a3210 per patient in the fi rst year and \u00a3647 in subsequent years.\nThe yield of lung parenchyma resulting in clinically useful histopathological\ndiagnoses from conventional transbronchial biopsy specimens is on the order of 38% (44), and the yield of nonspeci fi c in fl ammation and fi brosis varies from 21 to 48% (45). Thus, conventional transbronchial biopsy does not compare well with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy, which has a speci fi city of 57% for DPLDs. In a cross-sectional study of 117 patients with UIP on high-resolution computed tomography, where half of the patients\nunderwent either transbronchial lung cryobiopsy or surgical lung biopsy, Tomassetti and colleagues (25) observed that the proportion of IPF cases diagnosed with a high degree of con fi dence increased from 16 to 63% after adding cryobiopsy in the process. Pathologists experienced in cryobiopsy analysis had an agreement nearly equivalent to surgical lung biopsy (0.73 for cryobiopsy vs. 0.86 for surgical lung biopsy), and the diagnoses obtained by multidisciplinary team discussion were similarly distributed in the two groups (transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and surgical lung biopsy) (25). The current gold standard for the diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases, when surgical lung biopsy is incorporated into a multidisciplinary discussion, is limited by modest interobserver agreement by expert pathologists: ' moderate to good ' agreement for those interpreting ILD patterns, ' good ' agreement for IPF and connective tissue disease -related ILD, ' moderate ' agreement for nonspeci fi c interstitial pneumonia, and ' fair ' agreement for hypersensitivity pneumonitis (46).\nOur meta-analysis con fi rms the results of prior meta-analyses (5, 10 -12) that reported a pooled diagnostic yield of 81 to 85% for transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and 91 to 98% for VATS. However, there are important differences between ours and prior meta-analyses (5, 10 -12). Unlike our meta-analysis, none of the prior meta-analyses (5, 10 -12) analyzed other measures of diagnostic test accuracy (pooled sensitivity, speci fi city, diagnostic odds ratio, and SROC). Our meta-analysis excluded data from abstracts and conference proceedings, which were included in the pooled analyses by others (5, 12). Although the pooled incidence of post-procedural pneumothorax in our study (9.5% [5.9 -14.9%]) is similar to what has been previously reported, that of\nmoderate to severe bleeding differs greatly from a few (5, 10, 11). On the latter, our results are in contrast, probably because ours is a pooled data set from 16 studies, whereas, for example, Johannson and colleagues ' (11) is from 4 studies, Sharp and colleagues ' (5) is from 11 studies (including an abstract), Ravaglia and colleagues ' (12) is from 12 studies (including abstracts), and Ganganah and colleagues ' (10) is only from 3 studies.",

Estimates of sensitivity and diagnostic yield showed high heterogeneity, and the design of this meta-analysis limited us in exploring potential sources of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity can be explained by technical/procedural differences between bronchoscopists and selection bias in studies. Moreover, the reported endobronchial bleeding could have been underreported in different studies.",
