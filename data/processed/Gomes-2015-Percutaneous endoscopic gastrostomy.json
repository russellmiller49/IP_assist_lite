Nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding is a classic, time-proven technique, although its prolonged use can lead to complications such as lesions to the nasal wing, chronic sinusitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux, and aspiration pneumonia. Another method of infusion, percutaneous endoscopy gastrostomy (PEG), is generally used when there is a need for enteral nutrition for a longer time period. There is a high demand for PEG in patients with swallowing disorders, although there is no consistent evidence about its effectiveness and safety as compared to NGT.\n\n## bjectives\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness and safety of PEG compared with NGT for adults with swallowing disturbances.\n\n## earch methods\n\nWe searched The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS from inception to January 2014, and contacted the main authors in the subject area. There was no language restriction in the search.\n\n## election criteria\n\nWe planned to include randomised controlled trials comparing PEG versus NGT for adults with swallowing disturbances or dysphagia and indications for nutritional support, with any underlying diseases. The primary outcome was intervention failure (e.g. feeding interruption, blocking or leakage of the tube, no adherence to treatment).\n\n## ata collection and analysis\n\nWe used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. For dichotomous and continuous variables, we used risk ratio (Relative risk (RR)) and mean difference (MD), respectively with the random-effects statistical model and 95% confidence interval (CI). We assumed statistical heterogeneity when I$^{2} > 50%.\n\n## ain results\n\nWe included 11 randomised controlled studies with 735 participants which produced 16 meta-analyses of outcome data. Meta-analysis indicated that the primary outcome of intervention failure, occurred in lower proportion of participants with PEG compared to NGT (Relative risk (RR)\n0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.59, eight studies, 408 participants, low quality evidence ) and this difference was statistically significant. For this outcome, we also subgrouped the studies by endoscopic gastrostomy technique into pull, and push and not reported . We observed a significant difference favouring PEG in the pull subgroup (Relative risk (RR) 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.35, three studies, 90 participants). The push subgroup contained only one clinical trial and the result favoured PEG (Relative risk (RR) 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.74, one study, 33 participants) techniques. We found no statistically significant difference in cases where the technique was not reported (Relative risk (RR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.44, four studies, 285 participants).\nThere was no statistically significant difference between the groups for meta-analyses of the secondary outcomes of mortality (Relative risk (RR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.28, 644 participants, nine studies, very low quality evidence ), overall reports of any adverse event at any follow-up time point (ITT analysis, Relative risk (RR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34), 597 participants, 6 studies, moderate quality evidence ), specific adverse events including pneumonia (aspiration) (Relative risk (RR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.06, 645 participants, seven studies, low quality evidence ), Odds ratio (or) for the meta- analyses of the secondary outcome of nutritional status including weight change from baseline, and mid-arm circumference at endpoint, although there was evidence in favour of PEG for meta-analyses of mid-arm circumference change from baseline (MD 1.16, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.31, 115 participants, two studies), and levels of serum albumin were higher in the PEG group (MD 6.03, 95% CI 2.31 to 9.74, 107 participants).\nFor meta-analyses of the secondary outcomes of time on enteral nutrition, there was no statistically significant difference (MD 14.48, 95% CI -2.74 to 31.71; 119 participants, two studies). For meta-analyses of quality of life measures (EuroQol) outcomes in two studies with 133 participants, for inconvenience (Relative risk (RR) 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.29), discomfort (Relative risk (RR) 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.29), altered body image (Relative risk (RR) 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.18; P = 0.001) and social activities (Relative risk (RR) 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.18) the intervention favoured PEG, that is, fewer participants found the intervention of PEG to be inconvenient, uncomfortable or interfered with social activities. However, there were no significant differences between the groups for pain, ease of learning to use, or the secondary outcome of length of hospital stay (two studies, 381 participants).\n\n## uthors' conclusions\n\nPEG was associated with a lower probability of intervention failure, suggesting the endoscopic procedure may be more effective and safe compared with NGT. There is no significant difference in mortality rates between comparison groups, or in adverse events, including pneumonia related to aspiration. Future studies should include details of participant demographics including underlying disease, age and gender, and the gastrostomy technique.\n\n## ackground\n\nA number of conditions compromise the transport of food along the digestive tract. Patients with swallowing disturbances can develop low nutritional status, which affects their recovery from illness, surgery, and injury. Conditions associated with swallowing disorders include stroke, neurological diseases, dementia, cancers of the head and neck, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, physical obstruction, and dysphagia from stroke. Nasogastric tube feeding is a time proven technique to provide nutritional support; the tube can be inserted by a nurse. Percutaneous endoscopy gastrostomy (PEG) involves a feeding tube inserted directly into the stomach through the abdomen and is particularly useful when enteral nutrition is needed for a length of time.\n\n## eview question\n\nProlonged use of a nasal tube can lead to adverse events such as damage to the nose and larynx, chronic sinusitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux, and aspiration pneumonia (which can result from inhalation of stomach contents leading to lower respiratory tract infection and pneumonia).\n\n## tudy characteristics\n\nWe obtained updated evidence for this review from 11 randomised controlled studies comparing a nasogastric tube with PEG in a total of 735 patients. Seven studies measured treatment failure i.e. feeding interruption, blocking or leakage of the feeding tube in 408 patients randomised to either a nasal gastric tube or PEG.\n\n## ey results\n\nThe studies showed a higher probability of treatment failure with a nasal gastric tube. The number of deaths was no different with the two methods; nor was the overall occurrence of adverse events. Participants with PEGs may have a better quality of life.\n\n## uality of the evidence\n\nPossible limitations of this review include the small number of participants in the majority of studies, explained by the high cost of PEG and requirements for endoscopy in its use, the operational challenges to accomplish a clinical trial in this area and the different length of follow-up of the patients in the studies (from less than four weeks to six months). There were clinical differences between the trials, with the participants having different baseline diseases and different techniques used to insert the PEG. The findings of the present review of\nTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health.\nthe literature should be interpreted with caution, given that there were methodological issues with most of the included studies which increase the risk of bias in the trial. This systematic review of the literature is valuable in analysing 11 studies, with a sample size of 735 patients. Nevertheless, further randomised clinical trials that adopt a rigorous method are warranted.\n4\n\n## U M M A R Y O F F I N D I N G S\n\nSummary of findings for the main comparison.

Disturbances may be due to blockage, as seen in stenosis and cancer of the stomach or larynx, or due to swallowing difficulties such as in genetic diseases, stroke sequelae, cranial encephalic trauma, brain tumours, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Heemskerk 2014; L\u00f6ser 2005; Piecuch 2013; Schneider 2014). Several approaches are available to provide nutritional support (Nugent 2013). Nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding is a classic, time-proven technique, although its prolonged use can lead to adverse events such as lesions to the nasal wing, chronic sinusitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux, and aspiration pneumonia (Bastow 1986; Beavan 2010). Two meta-analyses comparing tube placement into the stomach or duodenum revealed no significant difference between the methods in terms of length of hospital stay, mortality, or adverse events (Ho 2006; Marik 2003). In addition to adverse events, the need to change the tube due to blockage inherent to its narrow gauge coupled with its disagreeable appearance in social settings have led to the election of alternative techniques whenever possible (Zaherah 2012).\nGastrostomy has been used to gain access to the stomach for long-term enteral feeding in patients with swallowing limitations who require nutritional support. The main criteria for indicating gastrostomy are (i) a reasonable prospect of patient survival and (ii) normal intestinal function (Friginal-Ruiz 2011). This surgical procedure was first carried out successfully in humans in 1876, by Verneuil in France. Following various modifications, Stamm devised the technique most frequently used to this day (Ljungdahl 2006). In 1980, Gauderer et al described a new technique of feeding tube placement in gastrostomy using endoscopy, called percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). This involves a local anaesthetic and does not require laparotomy (Gauderer 1980). Since the introduction of PEG, a number of studies comparing methods of gastrostomy have been conducted, such as operative, push and pull PEG techniques (K\u00f6hler 2014; Stiegmann 1990; Tucker 2003).\nPrevious systematic reviews and meta-analyses on enteral nutrition approaches have been performed, but not with the broad scope we propose. Langmore 2006 published a meta-analysis that investigated enteral nutrition, specifically in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, comparing the use of several types of feeding tubes in patients being fed orally. However, they did not find any controlled or randomised studies. Another meta-analysis compared nutrition by endoscopic gastrostomy and NGT including only post-stroke patients (Bath 1999). Thereafter, a number of controlled and randomised studies were published that compared the two methods of nutritional support in stroke patients and those admitted to intensive care units with a range of different pathologies, as well as individuals on mechanical ventilation (Dennis 2005; Douzinas 2006; Hamidon 2006; McClave 2005).\nAssessment of these latest studies in patients with a range of pathologies, together with analysis of the optimal moment to commence nutritional support, warrant mapping by means of a systematic review so as to offer the best evidence available on which to base decisions.\n\n## escription of the condition\n\nMalnutrition encompasses overnutrition and undernutrition, but undernutrition is a prevalent, and undesired condition affecting\nup to 40% of hospitalised patients (Barker 2011). This condition has important causal associations with morbidity and mortality, by affecting, for example, length of stay in hospital; recovery from illness, surgery and injury; cardiac function, weak muscles (including respiratory muscles), with consequent higher risk of thromboembolism, chest infection, and pressure sores (Geeganage 2012; Iwamoto 2014; L\u00f6ser 2010; Pearce 2002; Valente da Silva 2012). Mortality rates tend to be higher in elderly and undernourished patients in comparison to other subgroups of hospitalised patients (Ordo\u00f1ez 2013; Valente da Silva 2012). In this sense, swallowing disturbances are of special interest, because of its direct relationship with undernutrition (Poisson 2014).\nThe clinical diagnosis of swallowing disturbances can be given based on clinical signals such as delay in swallowing, pharyngeal sensibility, abnormality or absence of tongue movements; loosening of water from lips, pocketing of food in the cheek, under the tongue or on the hard palate, coughing or choking while eating or signs of penetration or aspiration (Falsetti 2009; Simons 2014). Although not usually used in daily practice, radiological tests like videofluoroscopic modified barium swallow and videofluoroscopic swallowing study can be used for diagnosis of dysphagia (Finestone 2003; Scheeren 2014; Stec 2008).\nPatients with indications for enteral nutrition (nutrients intake by means of feeding tubes) include those with conditions associated with swallowing disorders, such as motor neuron disease and multiple sclerosis; physical obstruction to swallowing, such as oesophageal tumours; an inability to ingest food due to head injury or stroke; and those with anorexia due to an underlying disease such as chronic lung disease, irritable bowel disease, or cancer (Botella Romero 2012; de Aguilar-Nascimento 2011; Fini 2014; Kola\u010dek 2013; Manba 2014). Dysphagic patients and those with anorexia, malabsorption, or excessive catabolism also may need long-term enteral feeding (Le 2010; Gentile 2012; Pearce 2002). Aspiration risk often is an indication for nutritional support using tubes (Corry 2008; Metheny 2010). Enteral nutrition can be provided in the form of drink supplements or, if a patient is unable to take adequate nutritional supplements orally, fed via an enteral tube into the stomach or small bowel (Granell Vidal 2014; L\u00f6ser 2005).\n\n## escription of the intervention\n\nIn general, tube systems for artificial enteral nutrition can be positioned by nasal insertion, guided percutaneous application, or surgical techniques (Abdel-Lah Mohamed 2006; Blumenstein 2014; Gopalan 2003; Schr\u00f6der 2004). The superiority of percutaneously placed gastrostomies compared with the former surgical gastrostomy procedures (that is, Witzel, Stamm, Janeway techniques) has been clearly suggested (L\u00f6ser 2005; Ljungdahl 2006). Lower complication rates, reduced hospital length of stay and costs have been reported (Grant 1988; Ljungdahl 2006). Most patients who require nutritional support need it for around one month or less, with the nasogastric sound probe being the main way of infusion (Blumenstein 2014; Pearce 2002). The probe used is made of thin polyurethane, size 14 with an internal diameter of 3.3 mm, and is inserted by a trained professional in order to prevent adverse events such as perforation and tracheobronchial location (Hamidon 2006; L\u00f6ser 2005). Another method of infusion, percutaneous endoscopy gastrostomy (PEG), is generally used when there is a need for enteral nutrition for a longer time period (L\u00f6ser 2005; Pearce 2002). This procedure can be done by either\n'pull' or 'push' techniques, the former being simpler and more frequently used. Both techniques use a silicon probe (for example 24 Fr, internal diameter 5.5 mm). The puncture site is marked with gastroscopic monitoring of the anterior gastric wall in the region of the distal corpus, after adequate local anaesthesia and intravenous sedation (Hamidon 2006; L\u00f6ser 2005). Prospective studies have shown that the early insertion of the probe via PEG improves the patient's nutritional state (Hamidon 2006; Norton 1996). Patients treated for head and neck carcinoma have considered PEG to be more acceptable than a NGT, even though persistent dysphagia was associated with PEG (Mekhail 2001). A cohort study verified the acceptability of PEG, with significantly higher survival time and lower aspiration rates (Dwolatzky 2001) compared to NGT. On the other hand, a narrative review (Plonk 2005) reported increased risk of death in stroke patients with PEG compared with NGT and concluded that aspiration pneumonia rates were similar. Published guidelines on enteral nutrition recommend the performing of gastrostomy, preferably endoscopically (L\u00f6ser 2005).\nRadiologically placed gastrostomy (RIG) is another method of enteral nutrition, but operationally different from PEG. RIG is not an endoscopic procedure and utilises fluoroscopy, performed in an interventional radiologic suite (Barkmeier 1998; Chi\u00f2 2004).\n\n## ow the intervention might work\n\nThe percutaneous gastronomy probe is of a larger calibre compared with an NGT and is placed in the abdomen. This leads to less interruption of nutrition caused by the probe being withdrawn as well as reduced reflux with consequent aspiration, thus being less embarrassing for the patient (Dwolatzky 2001; Pearce 2002). Patients and carers believe that nutrition via PEG helps in feeding and the ability to cope, being more convenient than NGT (Anis 2006). PEG-related morbidity and mortality are 9.4% and 0.53%, respectively (Wollman 1995). There are, however, exclusive adverse events for endoscopy percutaneous gastrostomy, such as peritonitis, buried bumper syndrome, gastrocolocutaneous fistula, and wound infection (Potack 2008). Adverse events associated with NGT due to its nasogastric insertion and positioning are also cited, including sinusitis, laryngeal ulcerations, pneumothorax, and tracheoesophagic fistula; the latter due to incorrect positioning of the tube (Pearce 2002).\n\n## hy it is important to do this review\n\nAccording to Potack 2008, there is a high demand for PEG in patients with swallowing disorders, with 160,000 to 200,000 PEG procedures performed per year in the USA. This makes PEG the procedure of choice for nutritional support in adults. The same author commented that many such procedures are performed, although there is no consistent evidence about what is the more effective and safe method. Because NGT and PEG are the most commonly used methods for feeding access (Pearce 2002), a systematic review is worth performing to resolve such questions.\n\n## B J E C T I V E S\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) as compared to a nasogastric tube (NGT) for adults with swallowing disturbances, by updating our previous Cochrane review (Other published versions of this review), assessing the included studies with the revised 'Risk of bias'\nassessments, and to assess the overall level of evidence using the GRADE approach.\n\n## ypes of studies\n\nRandomised controlled trials comparing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) versus nasogastric tube (NGT) for nutrition in adults with swallowing disturbances.\n\n## ypes of participants\n\nAdult patients presenting with swallowing disturbances or dysphagia and indications for nutritional support, as identified by the authors of primary studies. Patients with any underlying diseases were also acceptable.\n\n## ypes of interventions\n\nThe comparison arms of interest are as follows.\n\u00b7 Intervention group: PEG performed by any method (e.g., pull and push methods, others).\n\u00b7 Control group: NGT irrespective of technique (e.g., conventional and looping).\nWe did not include studies with radiologically inserted gastrostomy (PRG), nasojejunal tubes, and jejunal tube percutaneous endoscopy gastrostomy (JET-PEG) in this review.\n\n## rimary outcomes\n\n\u00b7 Intervention failures as defined by any event leading to failure to introduce the tube, recurrent displacement and treatment interruption (feeding interruption, blocking or leakage of the tube, no adherence to treatment) (based on Norton 1996).\n\n## econdary outcomes\n\n\u00b7 Nutritional status, as measured by any validated instrument (such as upper-arm skin fold thickness, mid-arm circumference, body weight, serum albumin level, haemoglobin (Ramel 2008)).\n\u00b7 Mortality.\n\u00b7 Adverse events (e.g., aspiration, haemorrhage, pneumonia, wound infection, sinusitis, fistula).\n\u00b7 Time on enteral nutrition.\n\u00b7 Quality of life, as measured by any validated instrument (such as EUROQoL, SF-36 (Dorman 1997)).\n\u00b7 Length of hospital stay.\n\u00b7 Costs and economic issues.\n\n## lectronic searches\n\nWe performed a computerised literature search in, re-running searches from the previous search date (August 2009). We carried out updated searches in September 2011 and in January 2014.\n\u00b7 The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2013, Issue 12) and other databases in The Cochrane Library (Appendix 1),\n\u00b7 Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily Update January 31, 2014, Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Ovid MEDLINE(R) 1946 to Present Appendix 2.\n\u00b7 EMBASE via OVID (Embase 1980 to 2014 Week 05) Appendix 3.\n\u00b7 LILACS via BIREME (from inception to January 2014) Appendix 4.\nSearch terms and their synonyms for clinical conditions of interest to us (swallowing disturbance or dysphagia) and interventions of interest (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and nasogastric tube feeding) are given in the appendices. They were adapted for each of the databases. There was no language restriction in the search. Search filters to identify randomised controlled trials involving humans were used when appropriate.\n\n## earching other resources\n\nWe compiled a reference list of relevant studies (irrespective of study design) to identify trials with the potential for inclusion. We contacted authors via email requesting the data from unpublished trials. We also tried to identify ongoing trials on the Current Controlled Trials Web site (www.currentcontrolledtrials.gov).\n\n## election of studies\n\nTwo review authors (CG, RA) checked the titles and abstracts found by the search strategy and other sources researched. Whenever titles or abstracts seemed relevant to the review, we analysed them by reading the full article. If they were truly randomised controlled trials that met the previously stated criteria, we included them in the review. If there remained any doubt or disagreement, all of the authors assessed the study in question.\n\n## ata extraction and management\n\nTwo review authors (CG, DRW) extracted data based on CONSORT (Moher 2001). For the update in 2014, CB with CG and DRW extracted data from new included studies. We settled doubts by consensus of the authors.\n\n## ssessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\nTwo review authors (CG, RBA, with CB) independently assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the following items (Higgins 2011).\n\u00b7 Random sequence generation (selection bias) . Biased allocation to interventions due to inadequate generation of a randomised sequence.\n\u00b7 Allocation concealment (selection bias). Biased allocation to interventions due to inadequate concealment of allocations prior to assignment.\n\u00b7 Blinding (performance bias and detection bias). Performance bias or detection bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions after assignment.\n\u00b7 Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias). Performance bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by participants and personnel during the study.\n\u00b7 Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias). Detection bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by outcome assessors.\n\u00b7 Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias). Attrition bias due to amount, nature or handling of incomplete outcome data.\n\u00b7 Selective reporting (reporting bias). Reporting bias due to selective outcome reporting.\n\u00b7 Other bias that is bias due to problems not covered elsewhere in the table.\nFor the above biases, we classified studies according to their risk of systematic error.\n\u00b7 High risk: when the appropriate method to avoid systematic error was not met.\n\u00b7 Unclear risk: when the appropriate method to avoid systematic error was not described or the information was not acquired by contacting the authors of primary studies.\n\u00b7 Low risk: when the appropriate method to avoid systematic error was met.\nWe did not use performance bias as a criterion to analyse the risk of systematic error since this was not compatible with the characteristics of the intervention.\n\n## easures of treatment effect\n\nFor dichotomous and continuous variables, we calculated risk ratio (Relative risk (RR)), mean difference (MD), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). When data from primary studies were not parametric (for example, effects were reported as medians, quartiles) or without sufficient statistical information (such as standard deviations, number of patients), we inserted them into Table 1 if authors did not provide the necessary information.\n\n## nit of analysis issues\n\nThe unit of analysis was based on the individual patient (unit to be randomised for interventions to be compared). We planned to analyse events happening to a person more than once (for example pneumonia, bronchoaspiration) by using risk ratio, which compares the rate of events in the two groups (PEG and NGT) by dividing one by the other. We planned to analyse cross-over study designs separately from the parallel-group randomised controlled trials.\n\n## ealing with missing data\n\nFor continuous and dichotomous data, we carried out available case analysis. In this update, for mean values of outcome data with missing standard deviations, we calculated this from the difference between means ( Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 7.7.3.3. Higgins 2011). We investigated the effects of making these assumptions by performing sensitivity analyses where appropriate.\n\n## ssessment of heterogeneity\n\nWe assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I$^{2} statistic. We assumed a statistically significant heterogeneity between the estimated effects of included studies with an I$^{2} > 50%.\n\n## ssessment of reporting biases\n\nWe had planned to assess publication bias by preparing a funnel plot, and will do so in future versions of this review if a sufficient number of studies is available. However, we are aware that asymmetry in the funnel plot can be associated with reasons other than that of publication bias (for example, by chance, real heterogeneity, or clinical particulars inherent to each one of the included studies such as patients at high risk for the outcome).\n\n## ualitative information\n\nWe synthesised qualitative information relative to methods, risk of bias, description of participants, and outcomes measures in the Characteristics of included studies table.\n\n## uantitative information\n\nFor dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio (Relative risk (RR)). For continuous variables, we calculated the mean difference (MD) when studies reported their results through the same variables measured with the same instruments (same units of measure). When continuous data were measured with different instruments (different and non-interchangeable units of measure), we planned to pool them using the standardised mean difference (SMD). We used 95% CIs for all statistical methods to pool data.\nIrrespective of the nature of the data, we used a random-effects statistical model as we were expecting substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity, which could generate substantial statistical heterogeneity.\n\n## ubgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity\n\nWe planned to carry out subgroup analyses using different NGT and PEG methods (for example pull, push, nasal loop, conventional). We assumed that heterogeneity between studies in both the direction and magnitude of estimate effect had a suspected causal relationship (the subgroup characteristic and the estimate of effect), and we have considered these in the Discussion section.\n\n## ensitivity analysis\n\nWe planned sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of intentionto-treat (ITT) analysis and available data analysis for dichotomous data. We planned to carry out ITT analysis by using imputation based on the analysis of the total number of randomised participants, irrespective of how the original study authors analysed the data. We assumed that all missing participants experienced the event. The other factors were study quality, trials reported only in abstracts, and testing for fixed-effect and randomeffects statistical models.\n\n## escription of studies\n\nSee Characteristics of included studies and Characteristics of excluded studies for more information.\n\n## esults of the search\n\nFor details of the process of studies selection, see Figure 1.\n\n## igure 1. Study flow diagram.\n\nThe first literature search (August 2009 to September 2011) yielded 474 hits. From this, 18 papers were retrieved for full text review. Three papers were excluded due to inappropriate study design and intervention. In January 2014, an update search yielded 663 additional records and two additional studies were identified for inclusion in the review.\n\n## ncluded studies\n\nThe 11 randomised controlled studies selected were published in English. In many cases the data we required were not available\nin the published report of the study and we obtained further information from the study investigators (e.g. Bath 2009; Corry 2008b), which were used to estimate the effects of the interventions for clinically relevant outcomes (i.e., treatment failure, mortality, pneumonia, adverse events, and length of hospital stay). Yata 2001 was only available in abstract form, which hampered the gleaning of all the relevant data, and the corresponding author could not be contacted. Data from another study (Bath 1997) came from a systematic review by the same author, and doubts were resolved via email with the corresponding author. Elbadawy 2014\nwas an unpublished study and we obtained further information by correspondence with the study investigator.\n\n## articipants and study design\n\nWe sought to compare percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) (n = 373 participants) with nasogastric tube (NGT) (n = 362 participants) placement for enteral feeding in adults (n = 735 total randomised participants).\nThe sample in Baeten 1992 included patients with different diseases, including neoplasia of the ear, nose, and throat and neurologic and post-operative diseases. The mean age of these patients was 72 years (range: 62 to 82 years). Park 1992 included only patients with dysphagia secondary to neurologic diseases in their sample. The mean age of these patients in the NGT group was 65 years, whereas the mean age of those in the PEG group was 56 years. Norton 1996 and Bath 1997 included in their sample patients with dysphagia after acute stroke with a mean age of 77 years. Yata 2001 studied patients with dysphagia in several diseases, such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and cerebrovascular disease. These patients had a mean age of 75.1 years (range: 50 to 96 years) in the PEG group and 76.5 years (range: 38 to 93 years) in the NGT group. Dennis 2005 included in their sample patients who presented with dysphagia after acute stroke. Their mean age was 76 years (SD = 10 years). Douzinas 2006 assessed patients with different diseases, some of whom presented with recurrent or persistent ventilator-associated pneumonia. These patients had a median age of 53 years (range: 20 to 82 years) in the PEG group and 58 years (range: 25 to 85 years) in the NGT group. Hamidon 2006 investigated patients with dysphagia after acute stroke with a median age of 65 years (range: 48 to 79 years) in the PEG group and 72 years (range: 54 to 77 years) in the NGT group. Finally, Corry 2008 included in their sample patients with cancer of the head and neck with a median age of 60 years (range: 46 to 80 years). In Sadasivan 2012, participants had advanced stage two or three squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and were scheduled either for radical surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), chemoRT, or for concurrent chemo and radiation therapy were included in the study. The age of participants in the study was not reported and we were unable to obtain further data. Elbadawy 2014, included participants with close traumatic severe brain injury in a study to determine whether PEG or NGT resulted in lower rates of ventilatorassisted pneumonia. The mean age of participants in the study was not reported and we were unable to obtain further data.\n\n## nterventions and comparisons\n\nThe interventions were PEG, inserted by any method, versus NGT. Further details can be found in the Characteristics of included studies tables.\nIn Elbadawy 2014, a three-arm study, NGT plus intubation was compared with PEG plus intubation and PEG plus tracheostomy. For the purposes of this review, we combined the two PEG groups and compared these results with the NGT group.\n\n## utcomes\n\nFollow-up times varied across the 11 studies analysed. Baeten 1992, Douzinas 2006, Park 1992, and Hamidon 2006 studied patients for\nno more than four weeks. On the contrary, the follow-up times of Bath 1997, Dennis 2005, Norton 1996, Yata 2001, and Corry 2008 ranged from three to six months. Elbadawy 2014 and Sadasivan 2012 followed up participants at one week, six weeks and six months.\nThe included studies reported our review outcomes as follows:\nOur primary outcome, intervention failure, was reported in eight studies (Baeten 1992; Bath 1997; Corry 2008; Hamidon 2006; Norton 1996; Park 1992; Sadasivan 2012; Yata 2001). Elbadawy 2014 reported the number of adverse events in each group; we requested further information, but the study investigators were not able to provide the number of patients with the primary review outcome of intervention failures (e.g., feeding interruption, blocking or leakage of the tube, no adherence to treatment). Participant non-adherence to treatment was reported in Sadasivan 2012,\nMortality was reported in nine studies (Baeten 1992; Bath 1997; Corry 2008; Dennis 2005; Douzinas 2006; Elbadawy 2014; Hamidon 2006; Norton 1996; Park 1992).\nAdverse effects were reported in seven studies (Baeten 1992; Corry 2008; Dennis 2005; Douzinas 2006; Elbadawy 2014; Norton 1996; Sadasivan 2012). Pneumonia, the result of aspirating food into the airway, was reported in seven studies (Baeten 1992; Corry 2008; Dennis 2005; Douzinas 2006; Elbadawy 2014; Norton 1996; Yata 2001). Reflux oesophagitis was reported in Yata 2001.\nTwo studies additionally reported measures related to the nutritional status of the participants: weight gain (Norton 1996; Sadasivan 2012), mid-arm circumference (Norton 1996; Sadasivan 2012), serum albumin levels (Norton 1996), and haemoglobin levels (Sadasivan 2012).\nThe length of hospital stay was reported in two studies (Dennis 2005; Elbadawy 2014); and the time of entry nutrition in days was reported in Baeten 1992 and Park 1992.\nOther outcome measures included quality-of-life measures using the EORTC QLQ-H&N35 scale in Corry 2008 and Sadasivan 2012. Scores of patient satisfaction and inconvenience of maintaining PEG or NGT by nursing staff were reported in Baeten 1992; it is unclear if these were validated scales. Participant functional ability (modified Rankin scale (MRS)), an indicator of quality of life, was reported in Dennis 2005.\nThe mean survival time in months was reported in Yata 2001.\n\n## xcluded studies\n\nThe three excluded studies did not meet the aforementioned inclusion criteria. McClave 2005 conducted a randomised controlled trial without interventions of interest for this review; Mekhail 2001 and Schulz 2009 performed retrospective studies. McClave 2008 was excluded following contact with the corresponding author to clarify the randomisation process employed.\n\n## llocation\n\nThe methods employed for allocation by Bath 1997; Corry 2008; Dennis 2005; Elbadawy 2014; Hamidon 2006; Park 1992 were suitable for this procedure; therefore, they were deemed low risk for systemic errors of a methodological nature. The remaining studies in this review (i.e., Baeten 1992; Douzinas 2006; Norton 1996; Sadasivan 2012; Yata 2001) were considered to be unclear for risk of bias because the methods used for allocation were not reported.\nThe methods used for allocation by Dennis 2005; Baeten 1992; Park 1992; and Norton 1996 were sufficiently sound to ensure concealment of the allocation process. Consequently, they were deemed low risk for systematic errors of a methodological nature. On the contrary, the studies by Bath 1997; Corry 2008; Douzinas 2006; Hamidon 2006; Sadasivan 2012; Yata 2001 were considered to be unclear for risk of bias. Although the authors described random allocation, they did not report the methods used for allocation concealment. No attempt was made to conceal allocation in Elbadawy 2014.\nOverall, no unusually large differences were noted in the demographic characteristics of patients from each group on study entry, except in Sadasivan 2012, where there were more participants in the PEG group who had radical surgery and adjuvant radio or chemotherapy, and more participants in the NGT group had concurrent chemo or radio therapy. Participants in the NGT group weighed more at the start of the trial.\n\n## linding\n\nThe characteristics of the interventions compared in this systematic review prevented the patients and physicians from being blinded to the interventions. Eight studies made no mention of blinding data assessors (Bath 1997; Douzinas 2006; Elbadawy 2014; Hamidon 2006; Norton 1996; Park 1992; Sadasivan 2012; Yata 2001). Three studies were considered as of high risk of detection bias, because their authors explicitly described either the absence of (Baeten 1992; Corry 2008), or flawed method of blinding data assessors (Dennis 2005).\n\n## ncomplete outcome data\n\nNine studies clearly reported both missing data and the flow of the patients during the study. As a result, they were considered low risk for systematic errors in follow-up losses. However, Yata 2001 and Sadasivan 2012 did not report losses or patient flow in their work; therefore, the study was considered to be unclear for risk of bias for this domain.\nIn Park 1992, 18 of the 19 patients in the NGT group presented intervention failure. The researchers did not follow these patients for the full 28 days. In contrast, all 19 patients from the PEG group completed the recommended follow-up period. Despite the significant number of failures in the NGT group, this clinical trial was considered low risk for systematic error for dichotomous variables because the authors clearly described the flow of patients from randomisation through to the study endpoint.\n\n## elective reporting\n\nAll of the studies were associated with a low risk of bias, given that relevant outcomes were reported in all cases.\n\n## ther potential sources of bias\n\nThe following studies were rated as having a high risk of bias: Baeten 1992 (follow-up not previously established), Bath 1997 and Yata 2001 (unpublished studies), Park 1992 (dropout rate of 95% (19/20) in the NGT group due to treatment failure and death).\n\n## ffects of interventions\n\nSee: Summary of findings for the main comparison Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy compared with nasogastric tube feeding for adults with swallowing disturbances\n\n## ntervention failure\n\nThe outcome of intervention failure (e.g., feeding interruption, blocking or leakage of the tube, no adherence to treatment) was reported in eight studies comprising 408 participants (Baeten 1992; Bath 1997; Corry 2008; Hamidon 2006; Norton 1996; Park 1992; Sadasivan 2012; Yata 2001). We were unable to obtain data on overall intervention failure rates in each group from Elbadawy 2014.\nFailure occurred in 9.22% (19 out of 206 participants) in the PEG group and 39.11% (79 out of 202 participants) in the NGT group. A meta-analysis of these eight studies using the random-effects model favoured the PEG group, that is, fewer participants in the PEG group experienced an intervention failure (risk ratio (Relative risk (RR)) 0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.59, P = 0.005; Analysis 1.1) (Mantel-Haenszel's statistical method). We found significant statistical heterogeneity in this analysis; I 2 = 73%.\n\n## on-adherence to treatment\n\nNon-adherence to treatment at six weeks was reported in only one study, Sadasivan 2012 and was not statistically significantly different in an analysis of 94 participants (Relative risk (RR) 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.17). Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses of non-adherence at six weeks (Relative risk (RR) 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.36) and at six months (Relative risk (RR) 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.16) however, were statistically significantly different and favoured the PEG group Analysis 1.2.\n\n## ubgroup analyses\n\nWe further subgrouped the studies by endoscopic gastrostomy technique into pull (n = 90), push (n = 33), and not reported (n = 285) in Analysis 1.3. We observed a significant difference favouring PEG in the pull subgroup (Relative risk (RR) 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.35, three studies, P = 0.001). The push subgroup contained only one clinical trial and the result favoured PEG (Relative risk (RR) 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.74, P = 0.03) techniques. We found no statistically significant difference in cases where technique was not reported (Relative risk (RR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.44). Statistically significant heterogeneity was found in the unreported technique subgroup (I$^{2} statistic = 73%), and the statistical significance of this result was unchanged in ITT analyses (Relative risk (RR) 0.37, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.45) Analysis 1.5.1.\nWe made a post-hoc decision to investigate the possible reasons for this heterogeneity in Analysis 1.4 using subgroup analysis. Therefore we subgrouped the studies by participant condition (Analysis 1.4). For participants with cerebrovascular events or neurological baseline diseases (n = 109), the result favoured the\nPEG group (Relative risk (RR) 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.33, P = 0.0005). There was no statistical heterogeneity in this analysis. For participants with mixed baseline diseases (n = 299), the intervention favoured neither PEG nor NGT(Relative risk (RR) 0.32, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.32), and statistical heterogeneity was high (I 2 = 79%), The statistical non-significance of this result, was unchanged in ITT analyses (Relative risk (RR) 0.29, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.33; Analysis 1.5.2).\n\n## ortality\n\nThe outcome of mortality was examined in nine studies (Baeten 1992; Bath 1997; Corry 2008; Dennis 2005; Douzinas 2006; Elbadawy 2014; Hamidon 2006; Norton 1996; Park 1992) (644 participants) and was assessed independently of study follow-up time. The results showed 35.76% (118 out of 330 participants) in the PEG group and 36.62% (115 out of 314 participants) in the NGT group (Relative risk (RR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.28) (Mantel-Haenszels statistical method). The result of the meta-analysis for mortality revealed no statistically significant difference between comparison groups. Finally, we observed statistical heterogeneity between included studies: I$^{2} statistic = 47%. Because of the radiologically placed gastrostomy technique used in a small number of participants in Dennis 2005, we carried out a sensitivity analysis to test the differences in the estimate effects by including and excluding this study. The sensitivity analysis shows that the inclusion of the FOOD study (Dennis 2005) did not change the statistical significance of the result for mortality (Relative risk (RR) 0.81 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.41, P = 0.84; Analysis 1.6) without Dennis 2005 (analysis not shown).\nOne study (n = 82) reported the mean survival time in months (Yata 2001) (MD 4.3, 95% CI 3.28 to 5.32; Analysis 1.7). The result favoured the PEG group, that is participants in the PEG group survived longer, for a mean of 11.4 months compared with 7.1 months in the NGT group.\n\n## omplications and adverse effects\n\nComplications and adverse effects (e.g., aspiration, haemorrhage, wound infection, sinusitis, fistula) were examined in six studies (Baeten 1992; Corry 2008; Dennis 2005; Douzinas 2006; Norton 1996; Sadasivan 2012) (597 participants) and was assessed independently of study follow-up time or severity of adverse effect. Although some of adverse events were characteristic of only one intervention, we analysed them together for the purposes of this review. The results showed 35.67% (107 out of 300 participants) in the PEG group and 45.79% (136 out of 297 participants) in the NGT group had adverse effects (Relative risk (RR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; Analysis 1.8) (Mantel-Haenszel's statistical method). The result of the meta-analysis for adverse effects revealed no statistically significant difference between the groups. We observed high statistical heterogeneity in the comparison: I$^{2} statistic = 87%. An ITT analysis of these data did not change the statistical significance of the result (Relative risk (RR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.35; Analysis 1.9)\nIn Elbadawy 2014, which was a study of critically ill participants who had experienced head injury, adverse events associated with PEG tracheostomy and nasogastric tube were reported. Adverse events were reported as number of events, rather than number of participants experiencing adverse events (that is, participants may have experienced more than one type of adverse event). In this study, the adverse events in the PEG group were infection in the gastrostomy tube in 19 participants, leakage around\nthe gastrostomy tube in 21 participants, dislodgement of the gastrostomy tube in 19 and obstruction of the PEG tube in two participants. Fistulas, perforations and 'buried pumper' syndrome (where the PEG tube migrates) were not seen. In the NGT group, paranasal sinusitis from the nasogastric tube was found in 12 participants (60%) (Table 2).\n\n## spriration (pneumonia)\n\nThe outcome of pneumonia (as a result of aspiration) was examined in seven studies (Baeten 1992; Corry 2008; Dennis 2005; Douzinas 2006; Elbadawy 2014; Norton 1996; Yata 2001) (645 participants) and was assessed independently of study follow-up time. The results showed 31.93% (106 out of 332 participants) pneumonia in the PEG group and 41.54% (130 out of 313 participants) in the NGT group (Relative risk (RR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.06; Analysis 1.10). However, the result of the meta-analysis for the pneumonia outcome did not favour PEG. We observed high levels of statistical heterogeneity between studies: I$^{2} statistic = 81%.\n\n## eflux oesophagitis\n\nDouzinas 2006 reported median change in gastro-oesophageal reflux at endpoint (day seven) as percentage of the time when the oesophageal pH was less than 4 in a given 24-hour period of time. The percentage was statistically significant, that is, less severe reflux was seen in the PEG group.\nYata 2001 reported reflux oesophagitis. In this single study analysis of 82 patients in total, there was a statistically significant result that favoured the PEG group (Relative risk (RR) 0.45, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.92; Analysis 1.11).\n\n## utritional status\n\nWe analysed data for nutritional status, as measured by any validated instrument (e.g. as upper-arm skin fold thickness, mid-arm circumference, body weight, serum albumin level, haemoglobin)\n\n## eight\n\nIn a single study analysis of weight (kg) at the study endpoint (Norton 1996) (mean difference (MD) 3.20, 95% CI -5.95 to 12.35; Analysis 1.12) The outcome favoured neither NGT Odds ratio (or) PEG. Three studies contributed to an analysis of weight change from baseline (n = 148, Corry 2008; Norton 1996; Sadasivan 2012) (MD 3.11, 95% CI -0.52 to 6.75; Analysis 1.13), that is, the outcome favoured neither NGT Odds ratio (or) PEG. In this analysis statistical heterogeneity was high I 2 = 93%.\n\n## id-arm circumference\n\nNorton 1996 reported mid-arm circumference in centimetres at the end point of the study and the change from baseline. The published report of Corry 2008 provided upper-arm circumference data for the NGT and PEG group as the median 300 mm (range 240 to 352) verus PEG 302.5, P= 0.69 (range 270 to 370) (mean 283 mm versus 295 mm respectively, P=0.25, not statistically significant, no standard deviations (SDs) reported Table 1). We calculated the missing SD values for the data from Corry 2008 and the result for a metaanalysis of both studies (n = 54) for arm circumference favoured neither intervention Odds ratio (or) control (MD 1.58, 95% CI -0.11 to 3.27; Analysis 1.14). No statistical heterogeneity was observed in this analysis I 2 = 0%. This overall result was unchanged in a sensitivity analysis (MD 2.50, 95% CI -0.64 to 5.64; Analysis 1.14.2)\nThe change in mid-arm circumference from baseline was measured in Norton 1996 and Sadasivan 2012. In this analysis of 115 participants, the results were statistically significant in favour of PEG (MD 1.16, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.31; Analysis 1.15).\nThe included studies also reported anthropometric outcome data as median values which we could not include in our meta-analyses (Table 1). Median triceps skin fold thickness was reported in Corry 2008 and Hamidon 2006 and these were not significantly different in either study, however in Corry 2008, the study reports states that the NGT patients had significantly lower triceps skin fold thickness (mean 9.5 versus 13.5 mm; P = 0.03 than the PEG patients at six weeks post-treatment). Median biceps skin fold (mm) and median arm circumference was reported in Hamidon 2006 (Table 1) and the differences between groups were not statistically significantly different in either case.\n\n## erum albumin\n\nMean serum albumin levels (g/dL) were reported in Yata 2001 and Norton 1996.\nYata 2001 was a short conference report and did not include SD values but reported that the serum albumin levels at three and six months were significantly different in the study report of Yata 2001 favouring PEG (P = <0.01) (Table 1). We calculated SD for this study using the difference between means and in an analysis of albumin levels of two studies of 107 participants, the result was statistically significant favouring the PEG group (MD 6.03, 95% CI 2.31 to 9.74; P = 0.001). Statistical heterogeneity was high I 2 = 75%. In a sensitivity analysis excluding Yata 2001, the result remained statistically significant, that is, using data only from Norton 1996, an analysis of albumin levels at endpoint in 25 participants indicated a statistically significant result in favour of PEG (MD 7.80, 95% CI 5.52 to 10.08; Analysis 1.16).\nSadasivan 2012 reported change in albumin levels from baseline and again this result was statistically significant in an analysis of 94 participants favouring PEG (MD 0.12, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.14; Analysis 1.17).\nThe median serum albumin endpoint values were lower in the NGT group in Hamidon 2006 (P = 0.054) (Table 1).\nHamidon 2006 also reported nutritional status outcome data as median values which we could not include in our meta-analyses (Table 1). Median serum albumin (g/L) was 39.5 (R 36 to 44) in the PEG groups versus 36.0 (R 31 to 45) in the NGT group. The P value was 0.045, which was statistically significantly different .\n\n## aemoglobin\n\nHaemoglobin levels were reported as a change from baseline in Sadasivan 2012, In this single study analysis of 94 participants, the results favoured PEG and was statistically significant (MD 0.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.69; Analysis 1.18).\nYata 2001 reported that mean haemoglobin levels (g/L) were 11.7 in the NG group and in the PEG group were 11.9 at three months, and 11.1 versus 12.4 at six months (Table 1).\n\n## ime of enteral nutrition\n\nTwo studies (n = 119) reported the duration of enteral feeding in days (Baeten 1992; Park 1992) (MD 14.48, 95% CI -2.74 to 31.71;\nAnalysis 1.21), this favoured neither NGT nor PGT and there were high levels of statistical heterogeneity present in this analysis (I$^{2} = 94%). These results should be interpreted cautiously as the assumption of normality for these outcomes may not be met.\n\n## ength of hospital stay\n\nTwo studies (n= 381) reported the length of hospital stay in days (Dennis 2005; Elbadawy 2014) (MD -12.67, 95% CI -40.18 to 14.84; Analysis 1.24), this favoured neither NGT nor PGT. There were high levels of statistical heterogeneity present in this analysis (I$^{2} = 93%). These results should be interpreted cautiously as the assumption of normality for these outcomes may not be met.\n\n## atient satisfaction\n\nPatient satisfaction was reported in Baeten 1992 (a five-point graded scale graded from 1 = very satisfied to 5 = very dissatisfied). In an analysis of 43 participants, the result favoured neither PEG nor NGT (MD -0.56, 95% CI -1.32 to 0.20) (Analysis 1.19). The inconvenience score (that is, inconvenience of maintaining the intervention to nursing staff in a scale with five categories) was also a statistically non-significantly different in an analysis of 68 patients in Baeten 1992 (MD -0.58, 95% CI -1.18 to 0.02; Analysis 1.20).\nQuality-of-life was measured in two studies (Corry 2008; Sadasivan 2012) and included in a meta-analysis (Analysis 1.22), Using the EORTC QLQ-H & N 35 Scale, and the number of participants who scored three or four (in this scale a high score is a worse outcome), the outcomes of pain, in an analysis of 133 participants, (Relative risk (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.00 to 471.74) and ease of learning to use (Relative risk (RR) 0.18, 95% CI 0.00 to 149.53), there was no statistically significant difference between the PEG and the NGT group. In analyses of 133 participants each for the outcomes of inconvenience (Relative risk (RR) 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.29; P=0.002) and discomfort (Relative risk (RR) 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.29; P = 0.002), altered body image (Relative risk (RR) 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.18; P = 0.001), and social activities (Relative risk (RR) 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.18; n= 100, P = 0.001), the intervention favoured PEG, that is, fewer participants found the intervention of PEG to be inconvenient, uncomfortable or interfered with family life or social activities, and this was a statistically significantly different between the groups. There was statistical heterogeneity present in the analysis of pain (I$^{2} = 95%) and ease of learning to use (I$^{2} = 94%), and low levels of statistical heterogeneity in the analyses of inconvenience and discomfort (I$^{2} = 21%).\nThe outcome of family life could not be entered into a metaanalysis as Corry 2008 did not report this subscale. Using data from Sadasivan 2012 only, this outcome favoured the PEG group and this was a statistically significantly different (Relative risk (RR) 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.18; n=100, P = 0.001).\nDennis 2005 reported the mean difference between comparison groups at endpoint derived from the EuroQol (reported as 0.035 95% CI -0.024 to 0.093). We could not include these data in our metaanalyses, but the report of the study states that the results were not statistically significantly different.\n\n## unctional ability\n\nA decline in functional ability while under treatment may be related to overall quality of life. Functional ability is the ability to perform basic activities of daily life without support, an important aspect of\noverall independence and quality of life. Just one study reported functional ability by using a modified Rankin Scale (MRS) (Dennis 2005). There was no statistically significant difference between comparison groups (Analysis 1.23) for the following ranges of Modified Rankin Scales (MRS): MRS 0 to 3 (Relative risk (RR) 0.59, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.01, P = 0.06) and MRS 4 to 5 (Relative risk (RR) 1.20, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.61, P = 0.21) and for the outcome composed by MRS scales from 4 to 5 Odds ratio (or) death as showed by the Relative risk (RR) of 1.10, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.20, P = 0.05).\n\n## osts and economic issues\n\nOnly one study provided information about costs and we did not include these data in any analyses. Corry 2008 stated that the \"cost of each feeding tube is $26 for a NGT and $110 for a PEG tube\" and \"The insertion costs are significantly different as the NGT are inserted by nursing staff in outpatients and the PEG tubes are inserted by surgeons in theatre. The cost for insertion of a NGT is $50 (includes nursing time and cost of chest X-ray), whereas the cost of insertion of a PEG tube is $626\".\n\n## ummary of main results\n\nThis systematic review of 11 included studies comprising 735 randomised participants in total (373 receiving percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and 362 nasogastric tube (NGT)), produced 16 meta-analyses in total, for the primary outcome of intervention failure (subgrouped by gastrostomy technique and by baseline disease) and for the secondary outcomes of mortality, adverse effects in total and also pneumonia as a result of aspiration, nutritional status including weight change from baseline, midarm circumference at endpoint and change from baseline, time of enteral nutrition in days, length of stay in days, and quality of life measured by the EuroQol scale.\nIn our meta-analyses, overall, the estimated effects for the primary outcome of intervention failure showed a statistically significant lower risk in the PEG group compared with the NGT group, and this was confirmed in subgroup analyses of intervention failure for both the 'push' and 'pull' gastrostomy techniques (subgroup analysis of those studies which did not report the gastrostomy technique showed no statistically significant difference between PEG or NGT). However, we cannot infer from the effect sizes that one technique (push or pull) is superior to the other as we did not carry out comparisons (indirect analysis) of the different techniques using data from separate studies.\nWe carried out additional intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses for the outcome of intervention failure specifically for the four studies with participants with mixed baseline diseases, and for intervention failure in the four studies where the gastrostomy technique was not reported, and we found no statistically significant differences between the PEG and NGT groups.\nNo direct causal relationship with the procedures was established for the secondary outcome of mortality i.e. there was no statistically significant difference between PEG or NGT for this outcomes. Only Dennis 2005 and Baeten 1992 reported a relationship between procedure-related mortality and global mortality, ranging from 0% to 10%. These low rates support the notion that the use of these methods may have no significant influence on risk of death.\nMeta-anaysis of adverse effects irrespective of follow-up time showed no statistically significant differences between the groups, and an ITT analysis of five studies for this outcome showed no statistically significant differences between the PEG and NGT groups. Fewer participants in the PEG group experienced pneumonia, an adverse event precipitated by aspiration of stomach contents or oro-pharyngeal secretions into the airway, but this difference was not statistically significant.\nThe meta-analyses of the secondary outcome of nutritional status i.e. weight change from baseline showed no statistically significant difference between the groups; endpoint mid-arm circumference was not statistically significantly different between the groups, although the outcome of mid-arm circumference in centimetres (change from baseline) was statistically significant in favour of PEG.\nThe meta-analysis of quality-of-life measures (a secondary outcome) was statistically significant favouring PEG (that is, more patients in the NGT group reported worse outcomes) for the outcomes of inconvenience, discomfort, altered or bad body image, social activities and in a single study analysis, interference with family life.\nWe also present analyses of data from single studies for the primary outcome of intervention failure that is non-adherence to treatment, and the secondary outcomes of adverse effects (specifically reflux oesophagitis), nutritional status including weight at endpoint, serum albumin levels and change from baseline, changes in haemoglobin levels g/dL from baseline, and measures of quality of life including scores of patient satisfaction and of inconvenience in maintaining the PEG or NGT by nurses, participant functional ability, and impact on family life measured by the EORTCQLQH&N35 (in one study).The single study analyses of the primary outcome non-adherence to treatment was statistically significant in favour of the PEG group at the six-week and six-month followup point in Sadasivan 2012 and notably all the dropouts from treatment were from the NGT group in that study (at six months there were no patients in the NGT group due to resumption of oral feeds (n = 10) or conversion to a PEG tube (n = 34).\nFor the secondary outcome of adverse effects, fewer patients in the Yata 2001 study reported reflux oesophagitis in the PEG group and this was statistically significant favouring PEG. For the secondary outcome of nutritional status, the mean participant body weight in kilograms at the endpoint, showed no statistically significant difference favouring PEG or NGT. Serum albumin levels at endpoint were statistically significant in Norton 1996, favouring the PEG group and also the serum albumin change from baseline were statistically significant favouring PEG in Sadasivan 2012. Haemoglobin levels expressed as a change from baseline also were higher in the PEG group and this was a statistically significant in the only study that reported this outcome (Sadasivan 2012).\nOutcomes relating to quality of life, including the scores of patient satisfaction and inconvenience in maintaining the intervention by nurses as reported in Baeten 1992, were not statistically significant in favour of either PEG or NGT. Functional ability reported in Dennis 2005 favoured neither PEG nor NGT.\nAnalyses of time on enteral nutrition and length of hospital stay favoured neither PEG nor NGT. However, these analyses of time are very unlikely to follow a normal distribution, so the analyses of mean differences are not necessarily accurate.These results should\nbe interpreted cautiously as the assumption of normality for these outcomes may not be met.\nThese conclusions were not changed by the 2014 update of the review.\n\n## verall completeness and applicability of evidence\n\nBased on the findings of this review, outcomes in participants who received nutritional support via a PEG may be more favourable that in those who have a NGT, especially for the outcome of intervention failure, based on an examination of 408 participants who had heterogeneous clinical and demographic characteristics.\nParticipants receiving PEG may be more likely to adhere to treatment at six weeks and six months. However, we found no evidence of a difference in mortality or adverse events (aspiration pneumonia) between the comparison groups. This non significant result does not imply no difference and we suggest that the review may not have had sufficient power to look at these less common events. Participants receiving PEG may experience less reflux oesophagitis (an adverse event). There is limited evidence, derived from single study results and small meta-analyses that PEG results in better outcomes in terms participants' nutritional status (mid-arm circumference, haemoglobin levels and serum albumin), and report better quality of life.\nWe found clinical heterogeneity between the studies and noted statistical heterogeneity in some of our analyses. For example, for our analyses of intervention failure, our primary outcome, we observed high levels of statistical heterogeneity resulting from the inclusion of the Baeten 1992 and Yata 2001 trials. One explanation for this may be the clinical heterogeneity between the trials, with the participants having different baseline diseases. We made a post-hoc decision to investigate the possible reasons for heterogeneity in the intervention failure meta-analysis as we assumed that the source of this statistical heterogeneity would be related to clinical heterogeneity. We hypothesised that baseline disease may have contributed to clinical heterogeneity and we categorised the studies by baseline disease, i.e. cerebrovascular event or neurological disorder versus mixed baseline disease (i.e. participants who may have had severe co-morbidities including cancer) and found that for the outcome of intervention failures in participants with cerebrovascular or neurological disease only, the results favoured PEG (i.e. fewer participants in the PEG group experienced any of the adverse events evaluated in the studies), but there was no difference between the groups for the mixed baseline disease subgroups and these studies included Baeten 1992 and Yata 2001. However, our hypothesis and the results of this analysis only point to one possible cause of heterogeneity, and this should be adequately tested in future studies. One further source of clinical heterogeneity in the remaining analyses could be because of the different techniques used to insert the PEG.\nMany of the studies reported continuous outcome data in a format that could not be incorporated in to our meta-analyses for example, median values. This limited the number of analyses that we could perform and we reported these data narratively in the review. Information reported in this way should be regarded as providing additional information only and the analyses we performed including meta-analysis, forest plots, tests for statistical heterogeneity provide more precise estimates of effects.\n\n## uality of the evidence\n\nThe findings of the present review of the literature should be interpreted with caution, given that almost half of the authors failed to report the method used to sequence and conceal the allocation (Figure 2; Figure 3). This is one of the main causes of error in randomised systematic studies. In addition, other potential risks of bias stemmed from the absence of prior planning of follow-up time, as well as the unpublished or high rates of losses during follow-up. However, almost all of the authors attempted to prevent attrition by making the flow of patients clear and through selective reporting bias by selecting clinically relevant outcomes. There are also challenges relating to the study design in terms of the numbers available for randomisation, following up such seriously ill patients and the high cost of the procedures in question. These factors may explain why the majority of studies involve small samples. It should be noted that all of the studies were judged at high risk of performance bias because it is not possible to blind participants and personnel in studies of this nature. In all cases of uncertainly we attempted to obtain further information or disaggregated data from the trial investigator, but where this was not available it was because the investigator no longer had access to historical trial data, or was unable to provide additional information. This systematic review of the literature is valuable in analysing 11 studies, thereby increasing the sample size to 735 participants. Nevertheless, further randomised clinical trials that adopt a rigorous method are warranted.\nWe rated the overall quality of the evidence as moderate or low for the key outcomes of treatment failure, mortality, pneumonia and adverse events (Summary of findings for the main comparison), resulting in lower confidence in the estimate of effect for those outcomes and further research is likely to have an important impact in our confidence in the estimate of effect and may even change the estimate. Where we downgraded the evidence, it was because there was risk of bias in the trial, out of eight estimates of potential bias (random sequence generation; allocation concealment; incomplete outcome data; selective reporting; blinding of participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assessment, and other bias) only six studies obtained scores of four or more. The included studies involved relatively few participants and wide confidence intervals (imprecision), although it is accepted that large scale studies of this type would be very difficult to perform. The results of many meta-analyses had high levels of statistical heterogeneity (inconsistency).\n\n## otential biases in the review process\n\nIn view of the sensitive search strategy involving electronic correspondence with the eminent authors in this area of research, we believe that it is highly unlikely that other studies meeting the inclusion criteria of this systematic review were overlooked, however this remains a possibility and could be regarded as a limitation of this review.\nWhile we included adverse effects reported in the studies included in this the review, we may not have detected reports of all of serious and/or rare adverse events associated with PEG or NGT, and in common with many systematic review and meta-analyses, this is a could be limitation of this review.\nAs outlined, all efforts were made to ensure that relevant qualitative or quantitative data were included in this review.\n\n## greements and disagreements with other studies or reviews\n\nIn one of the major controlled randomised trials performed to date (Dennis 2005), the authors suggested that NGT should be the method of choice in the first two to three weeks of enteral feeding, probably in light of the increased absolute risk of death associated with the use of PEG (Relative risk (RR) 1.02, P = 0.86) and the absolute risk of the outcome composed by MRS scale (modified Rankin scale) from four to five or death (Relative risk (RR) 1.10, P = 0.05). However, combining the results of 11 different studies with \u2245 400 patients, it seems that the PEG option is associated with a lower risk of intervention failure. Given the importance of this finding, selecting PEG might reduce the difference in cost between the two procedures. The findings of all of the other studies included in this analysis seem to support the use of PEG. Guidelines suggest that PEG is a highly effective and safe procedure when modern equipment is used, established standards are followed (L\u00f6ser 2005). However, a careful patient selection and professional proficiency are fundamental for better outcomes (Blumenstein 2014; Skitt 2011). In a narrative review, Plonk 2005 suggested that the use of PEG should only be considered in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, intestinal blockage by malignant tumour with incoercible vomiting, persistent dysphagia after acute stroke, and early head and neck cancer. However, the results of a systematic review that included studies with different designs suggests that PEG and NGT have the same effectiveness and safety for patients with head and neck cancer, even considering relevant outcomes, such as mortality and nutritional status (Wang 2014). Although no study included in our systematic review made available information about the use of nasal looping technique, there is some evidence that such NGT technique has potential to be preferable over PEG (Anderson 2004).\n\n## mplications for practice\n\nBased on the findings of this meta-analysis, the results favoured PEG rather than NGT for intervention failure, but not for mortality and pneumonia rates, and other adverse events. There may be some advantage in terms of nutritional status in using PEG over NGT, and patients may report better quality of life when using a PEG tube.\nIn routine practice, however, the costs and benefits of both procedures should be taken into account. Some health service providers, particularly under the public health system, face difficulties acquiring endoscopic gastrostomy apparatus due to their high cost. Possible reasons for the current state of the research in this area include the high cost of the procedures in question. Corry 2008 provided an example of this stating that the \"cost of each feeding tube is $26 for a NGT and $110 for a PEG tube\" However, it is noteworthy that because nasogastric tubes are easier to introduce\n(more often by the nursing team) and less weight is placed on the cost of constantly changing them as stated in Corry 2008 \"The insertion costs are significantly different as the NGT are inserted by nursing staff in outpatients and the PEG tubes are inserted by surgeons in theatre. The cost for insertion of a NGT is $50 (includes nursing time and cost of chest X-ray), whereas the cost of insertion of a PEG tube is $626\". Therefore endoscopic gastrostomies may be less frequently indicated (Corry 2008).\nIt is important to note that in clinical practice, an endoscopic examination performed prior to PEG insertion is indicated in all cases, as the patient might present with lesions of the gastrointestinal tract, which prevents the passage of the endoscopy device and even tubes. In such patients, gastric tumours might also be present, which precludes gastrostomy. Partial gastric resections can also influence patients to elect to use alternative methods of enteral feeding.\n\n## mplications for research\n\nOur systematic review of the current evidence, carried out in 2014, indicated that information is available on important outcomes such as intervention failure, mortality, pneumonia and adverse events. The included studies were carried out with participants with varying baseline diseases including neurological baseline diseases and those with malignancies. Future studies should provide adequate baseline information such as baseline disease, gender and age of the participants. The gastrostomy technique was described only in some of the included studies, and future researchers should ideally specify the technique used and the experience of the professionals involved to allow for the analysis of more specific subgroups. Data on the nutritional status of the patients would prove valuable, as would a cost/benefit analysis of the number of feeding tubes used. Quality-of-life measures provide useful information about patient important outcomes and may help explain differences in adherence to treatment.\nThe high cost of the procedures in question combined with the difficulties associated with the randomisation and long-term follow-up of patients and explain why the majority of studies examine a small number of participants. Nevertheless, we believe that further randomised clinical trials should be conducted with rigorous observation of internal validity. They should also include previously planned and executed follow-up periods.\n\n## C K N O W L E D G E M E N T S\n\nWe would like to thank the methodological support of the Brazilian Cochrane Centre and the CAPES (Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior) - Brazilian Ministry of Education for the scholarship.\nWe thank the Cochrane UGPD group for their support in the preparation of this updated review.\n\n## aeten 1992 {published data only}\n\nBaeten C, Hoefnagels J.

The criteria were modified according to the new Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011)\n\n## election bias\n\n\u00b7 Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?\n\u00b7 Was allocation adequately concealed?\n\u00b7 Were there systematic differences between the baseline characteristics of the groups that were compared?\n\n## ttrition bias\n\nWere there systematic differences between groups in withdrawals from a study?\n\n## etection bias\n\nWere there systematic differences between groups in how outcomes were determined?\nWe included data in the analyses of scores of patient satisfaction and inconvenience to nursing staff from Baeten 1992, theses are fivepoint scales and it is unclear if these were validated scales.\nIn this update, for mean values of outcome data with missing standard deviations, we calculated this from the difference between means ( Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 7.7.3.3. Higgins 2011). We investigated the effects of making these assumptions by performing sensitivity analyses where appropriate.\n\n## utcomes\n\nWe report outcomes as specified in the protocol and clarify the following: pneumonia in this instance occurs as a direct result of aspiration of food. Functional ability is included as an indicator of quality of life. Oesophageal reflux and reflux oesophagitis are adverse effects. We have included survival time as an additional outcome grouped with mortality.\n\n## ata synthesis\n\nWe planned to pool continuous data using SMD, but where the units of measurement were the same we used MD.\n\n## ubgroup analyses\n\nWe made a post-hoc decision to investigate the possible reasons for heterogeneity in the intervention failure meta-analysis as we assumed that the source of this statistical heterogeneity would be related to clinical heterogeneity. We categorised the studies by baseline disease, i.e. cerebrovascular event or neurological disorder versus mixed baseline disease (i.e. participants who may have had severe co-morbidities including cancer).\n\n## edical Subject Headings (MeSH)\n\nDeglutition Disorders [*complications]; Enteral Nutrition [*methods] [mortality]; Gastrostomy [adverse effects] [*methods] [mortality]; Intubation, Gastrointestinal [adverse effects] [methods] [mortality]; Malnutrition [etiology] [*therapy]; Pneumonia [etiology]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Failure\nTrusted evidence.

For these variables, the authors referred that \"fol- low-up was masked to treatment allocation (except where patients or carers inadvertently unmasked an interviewer at follow-up; such occurrences were unusual but their frequency was not systematically recorded)\".

Nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding is a classic, time-proven technique, although its prolonged use can lead to complications such as lesions to the nasal wing, chronic sinusitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux, and aspiration pneumonia. Another method of infusion, percutaneous endoscopy gastrostomy (PEG), is generally used when there is a need for enteral nutrition for a longer time period. There is a high demand for PEG in patients with swallowing disorders, although there is no consistent evidence about its effectiveness and safety as compared to NGT.",

      "content": "A number of conditions compromise the passage of food along the digestive tract. Disturbances may be due to blockage, as seen in stenosis and cancer of the stomach or larynx, or due to swallowing difficulties such as in genetic diseases, stroke sequelae, cranial encephalic trauma, brain tumours, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Heemskerk 2014; L\u00f6ser 2005; Piecuch 2013; Schneider 2014). Several approaches are available to provide nutritional support (Nugent 2013). Nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding is a classic, time-proven technique, although its prolonged use can lead to adverse events such as lesions to the nasal wing, chronic sinusitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux, and aspiration pneumonia (Bastow 1986; Beavan 2010). Two meta-analyses comparing tube placement into the stomach or duodenum revealed no significant difference between the methods in terms of length of hospital stay, mortality, or adverse events (Ho 2006; Marik 2003). In addition to adverse events, the need to change the tube due to blockage inherent to its narrow gauge coupled with its disagreeable appearance in social settings have led to the election of alternative techniques whenever possible (Zaherah 2012).\nGastrostomy has been used to gain access to the stomach for long-term enteral feeding in patients with swallowing limitations who require nutritional support. The main criteria for indicating gastrostomy are (i) a reasonable prospect of patient survival and (ii) normal intestinal function (Friginal-Ruiz 2011). This surgical procedure was first carried out successfully in humans in 1876, by Verneuil in France. Following various modifications, Stamm devised the technique most frequently used to this day (Ljungdahl 2006). In 1980, Gauderer et al described a new technique of feeding tube placement in gastrostomy using endoscopy, called percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). This involves a local anaesthetic and does not require laparotomy (Gauderer 1980). Since the introduction of PEG, a number of studies comparing methods of gastrostomy have been conducted, such as operative, push and pull PEG techniques (K\u00f6hler 2014; Stiegmann 1990; Tucker 2003).\nPrevious systematic reviews and meta-analyses on enteral nutrition approaches have been performed, but not with the broad scope we propose. Langmore 2006 published a meta-analysis that investigated enteral nutrition, specifically in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, comparing the use of several types of feeding tubes in patients being fed orally. However, they did not find any controlled or randomised studies. Another meta-analysis compared nutrition by endoscopic gastrostomy and NGT including only post-stroke patients (Bath 1999). Thereafter, a number of controlled and randomised studies were published that compared the two methods of nutritional support in stroke patients and those admitted to intensive care units with a range of different pathologies, as well as individuals on mechanical ventilation (Dennis 2005; Douzinas 2006; Hamidon 2006; McClave 2005).\nAssessment of these latest studies in patients with a range of pathologies, together with analysis of the optimal moment to commence nutritional support, warrant mapping by means of a systematic review so as to offer the best evidence available on which to base decisions.",

      "content": "Malnutrition encompasses overnutrition and undernutrition, but undernutrition is a prevalent, and undesired condition affecting\nup to 40% of hospitalised patients (Barker 2011). This condition has important causal associations with morbidity and mortality, by affecting, for example, length of stay in hospital; recovery from illness, surgery and injury; cardiac function, weak muscles (including respiratory muscles), with consequent higher risk of thromboembolism, chest infection, and pressure sores (Geeganage 2012; Iwamoto 2014; L\u00f6ser 2010; Pearce 2002; Valente da Silva 2012). Mortality rates tend to be higher in elderly and undernourished patients in comparison to other subgroups of hospitalised patients (Ordo\u00f1ez 2013; Valente da Silva 2012). In this sense, swallowing disturbances are of special interest, because of its direct relationship with undernutrition (Poisson 2014).\nThe clinical diagnosis of swallowing disturbances can be given based on clinical signals such as delay in swallowing, pharyngeal sensibility, abnormality or absence of tongue movements; loosening of water from lips, pocketing of food in the cheek, under the tongue or on the hard palate, coughing or choking while eating or signs of penetration or aspiration (Falsetti 2009; Simons 2014). Although not usually used in daily practice, radiological tests like videofluoroscopic modified barium swallow and videofluoroscopic swallowing study can be used for diagnosis of dysphagia (Finestone 2003; Scheeren 2014; Stec 2008).\nPatients with indications for enteral nutrition (nutrients intake by means of feeding tubes) include those with conditions associated with swallowing disorders, such as motor neuron disease and multiple sclerosis; physical obstruction to swallowing, such as oesophageal tumours; an inability to ingest food due to head injury or stroke; and those with anorexia due to an underlying disease such as chronic lung disease, irritable bowel disease, or cancer (Botella Romero 2012; de Aguilar-Nascimento 2011; Fini 2014; Kola\u010dek 2013; Manba 2014). Dysphagic patients and those with anorexia, malabsorption, or excessive catabolism also may need long-term enteral feeding (Le 2010; Gentile 2012; Pearce 2002). Aspiration risk often is an indication for nutritional support using tubes (Corry 2008; Metheny 2010). Enteral nutrition can be provided in the form of drink supplements or, if a patient is unable to take adequate nutritional supplements orally, fed via an enteral tube into the stomach or small bowel (Granell Vidal 2014; L\u00f6ser 2005).",

      "content": "In general, tube systems for artificial enteral nutrition can be positioned by nasal insertion, guided percutaneous application, or surgical techniques (Abdel-Lah Mohamed 2006; Blumenstein 2014; Gopalan 2003; Schr\u00f6der 2004). The superiority of percutaneously placed gastrostomies compared with the former surgical gastrostomy procedures (that is, Witzel, Stamm, Janeway techniques) has been clearly suggested (L\u00f6ser 2005; Ljungdahl 2006). Lower complication rates, reduced hospital length of stay and costs have been reported (Grant 1988; Ljungdahl 2006). Most patients who require nutritional support need it for around one month or less, with the nasogastric sound probe being the main way of infusion (Blumenstein 2014; Pearce 2002). The probe used is made of thin polyurethane, size 14 with an internal diameter of 3.3 mm, and is inserted by a trained professional in order to prevent adverse events such as perforation and tracheobronchial location (Hamidon 2006; L\u00f6ser 2005). Another method of infusion, percutaneous endoscopy gastrostomy (PEG), is generally used when there is a need for enteral nutrition for a longer time period (L\u00f6ser 2005; Pearce 2002). This procedure can be done by either\n'pull' or 'push' techniques, the former being simpler and more frequently used. Both techniques use a silicon probe (for example 24 Fr, internal diameter 5.5 mm). The puncture site is marked with gastroscopic monitoring of the anterior gastric wall in the region of the distal corpus, after adequate local anaesthesia and intravenous sedation (Hamidon 2006; L\u00f6ser 2005). Prospective studies have shown that the early insertion of the probe via PEG improves the patient's nutritional state (Hamidon 2006; Norton 1996). Patients treated for head and neck carcinoma have considered PEG to be more acceptable than a NGT, even though persistent dysphagia was associated with PEG (Mekhail 2001). A cohort study verified the acceptability of PEG, with significantly higher survival time and lower aspiration rates (Dwolatzky 2001) compared to NGT. On the other hand, a narrative review (Plonk 2005) reported increased risk of death in stroke patients with PEG compared with NGT and concluded that aspiration pneumonia rates were similar. Published guidelines on enteral nutrition recommend the performing of gastrostomy, preferably endoscopically (L\u00f6ser 2005).\nRadiologically placed gastrostomy (RIG) is another method of enteral nutrition, but operationally different from PEG. RIG is not an endoscopic procedure and utilises fluoroscopy, performed in an interventional radiologic suite (Barkmeier 1998; Chi\u00f2 2004).",

This leads to less interruption of nutrition caused by the probe being withdrawn as well as reduced reflux with consequent aspiration, thus being less embarrassing for the patient (Dwolatzky 2001; Pearce 2002). Patients and carers believe that nutrition via PEG helps in feeding and the ability to cope, being more convenient than NGT (Anis 2006). PEG-related morbidity and mortality are 9.4% and 0.53%, respectively (Wollman 1995). There are, however, exclusive adverse events for endoscopy percutaneous gastrostomy, such as peritonitis, buried bumper syndrome, gastrocolocutaneous fistula, and wound infection (Potack 2008). Adverse events associated with NGT due to its nasogastric insertion and positioning are also cited, including sinusitis, laryngeal ulcerations, pneumothorax, and tracheoesophagic fistula; the latter due to incorrect positioning of the tube (Pearce 2002).",

The same author commented that many such procedures are performed, although there is no consistent evidence about what is the more effective and safe method.

The mean age of these patients was 72 years (range: 62 to 82 years). Park 1992 included only patients with dysphagia secondary to neurologic diseases in their sample. The mean age of these patients in the NGT group was 65 years, whereas the mean age of those in the PEG group was 56 years. Norton 1996 and Bath 1997 included in their sample patients with dysphagia after acute stroke with a mean age of 77 years. Yata 2001 studied patients with dysphagia in several diseases, such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and cerebrovascular disease. These patients had a mean age of 75.1 years (range: 50 to 96 years) in the PEG group and 76.5 years (range: 38 to 93 years) in the NGT group. Dennis 2005 included in their sample patients who presented with dysphagia after acute stroke. Their mean age was 76 years (SD = 10 years). Douzinas 2006 assessed patients with different diseases, some of whom presented with recurrent or persistent ventilator-associated pneumonia. These patients had a median age of 53 years (range: 20 to 82 years) in the PEG group and 58 years (range: 25 to 85 years) in the NGT group. Hamidon 2006 investigated patients with dysphagia after acute stroke with a median age of 65 years (range: 48 to 79 years) in the PEG group and 72 years (range: 54 to 77 years) in the NGT group. Finally, Corry 2008 included in their sample patients with cancer of the head and neck with a median age of 60 years (range: 46 to 80 years). In Sadasivan 2012, participants had advanced stage two or three squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and were scheduled either for radical surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), chemoRT, or for concurrent chemo and radiation therapy were included in the study.

On the contrary, the follow-up times of Bath 1997, Dennis 2005, Norton 1996, Yata 2001, and Corry 2008 ranged from three to six months. Elbadawy 2014 and Sadasivan 2012 followed up participants at one week, six weeks and six months.\nThe included studies reported our review outcomes as follows:\nOur primary outcome, intervention failure, was reported in eight studies (Baeten 1992; Bath 1997; Corry 2008; Hamidon 2006; Norton 1996; Park 1992; Sadasivan 2012; Yata 2001). Elbadawy 2014 reported the number of adverse events in each group; we requested further information, but the study investigators were not able to provide the number of patients with the primary review outcome of intervention failures (e.g., feeding interruption, blocking or leakage of the tube, no adherence to treatment). Participant non-adherence to treatment was reported in Sadasivan 2012,\nMortality was reported in nine studies (Baeten 1992; Bath 1997; Corry 2008; Dennis 2005; Douzinas 2006; Elbadawy 2014; Hamidon 2006; Norton 1996; Park 1992).\nAdverse effects were reported in seven studies (Baeten 1992; Corry 2008; Dennis 2005; Douzinas 2006; Elbadawy 2014; Norton 1996; Sadasivan 2012). Pneumonia, the result of aspirating food into the airway, was reported in seven studies (Baeten 1992; Corry 2008; Dennis 2005; Douzinas 2006; Elbadawy 2014; Norton 1996; Yata 2001). Reflux oesophagitis was reported in Yata 2001.\nTwo studies additionally reported measures related to the nutritional status of the participants: weight gain (Norton 1996; Sadasivan 2012), mid-arm circumference (Norton 1996; Sadasivan 2012), serum albumin levels (Norton 1996), and haemoglobin levels (Sadasivan 2012).\nThe length of hospital stay was reported in two studies (Dennis 2005; Elbadawy 2014); and the time of entry nutrition in days was reported in Baeten 1992 and Park 1992.\nOther outcome measures included quality-of-life measures using the EORTC QLQ-H&N35 scale in Corry 2008 and Sadasivan 2012. Scores of patient satisfaction and inconvenience of maintaining PEG or NGT by nursing staff were reported in Baeten 1992; it is unclear if these were validated scales. Participant functional ability (modified Rankin scale (MRS)), an indicator of quality of life, was reported in Dennis 2005.\nThe mean survival time in months was reported in Yata 2001.",

The remaining studies in this review (i.e., Baeten 1992; Douzinas 2006; Norton 1996; Sadasivan 2012; Yata 2001) were considered to be unclear for risk of bias because the methods used for allocation were not reported.\nThe methods used for allocation by Dennis 2005; Baeten 1992; Park 1992; and Norton 1996 were sufficiently sound to ensure concealment of the allocation process. Consequently, they were deemed low risk for systematic errors of a methodological nature.

Although the authors described random allocation, they did not report the methods used for allocation concealment. No attempt was made to conceal allocation in Elbadawy 2014.\nOverall, no unusually large differences were noted in the demographic characteristics of patients from each group on study entry, except in Sadasivan 2012, where there were more participants in the PEG group who had radical surgery and adjuvant radio or chemotherapy, and more participants in the NGT group had concurrent chemo or radio therapy.

The researchers did not follow these patients for the full 28 days. In contrast, all 19 patients from the PEG group completed the recommended follow-up period.

In this study, the adverse events in the PEG group were infection in the gastrostomy tube in 19 participants, leakage around\nthe gastrostomy tube in 21 participants, dislodgement of the gastrostomy tube in 19 and obstruction of the PEG tube in two participants. Fistulas, perforations and 'buried pumper' syndrome (where the PEG tube migrates) were not seen.

However, we cannot infer from the effect sizes that one technique (push or pull) is superior to the other as we did not carry out comparisons (indirect analysis) of the different techniques using data from separate studies.\nWe carried out additional intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses for the outcome of intervention failure specifically for the four studies with participants with mixed baseline diseases, and for intervention failure in the four studies where the gastrostomy technique was not reported, and we found no statistically significant differences between the PEG and NGT groups.\nNo direct causal relationship with the procedures was established for the secondary outcome of mortality i.e. there was no statistically significant difference between PEG or NGT for this outcomes. Only Dennis 2005 and Baeten 1992 reported a relationship between procedure-related mortality and global mortality, ranging from 0% to 10%. These low rates support the notion that the use of these methods may have no significant influence on risk of death.\nMeta-anaysis of adverse effects irrespective of follow-up time showed no statistically significant differences between the groups, and an ITT analysis of five studies for this outcome showed no statistically significant differences between the PEG and NGT groups. Fewer participants in the PEG group experienced pneumonia, an adverse event precipitated by aspiration of stomach contents or oro-pharyngeal secretions into the airway, but this difference was not statistically significant.\nThe meta-analyses of the secondary outcome of nutritional status i.e. weight change from baseline showed no statistically significant difference between the groups; endpoint mid-arm circumference was not statistically significantly different between the groups, although the outcome of mid-arm circumference in centimetres (change from baseline) was statistically significant in favour of PEG.\nThe meta-analysis of quality-of-life measures (a secondary outcome) was statistically significant favouring PEG (that is, more patients in the NGT group reported worse outcomes) for the outcomes of inconvenience, discomfort, altered or bad body image, social activities and in a single study analysis, interference with family life.\nWe also present analyses of data from single studies for the primary outcome of intervention failure that is non-adherence to treatment, and the secondary outcomes of adverse effects (specifically reflux oesophagitis), nutritional status including weight at endpoint, serum albumin levels and change from baseline, changes in haemoglobin levels g/dL from baseline, and measures of quality of life including scores of patient satisfaction and of inconvenience in maintaining the PEG or NGT by nurses, participant functional ability, and impact on family life measured by the EORTCQLQH&N35 (in one study).The single study analyses of the primary outcome non-adherence to treatment was statistically significant in favour of the PEG group at the six-week and six-month followup point in Sadasivan 2012 and notably all the dropouts from treatment were from the NGT group in that study (at six months there were no patients in the NGT group due to resumption of oral feeds (n = 10) or conversion to a PEG tube (n = 34).\nFor the secondary outcome of adverse effects, fewer patients in the Yata 2001 study reported reflux oesophagitis in the PEG group and this was statistically significant favouring PEG. For the secondary outcome of nutritional status, the mean participant body weight in kilograms at the endpoint, showed no statistically significant difference favouring PEG or NGT. Serum albumin levels at endpoint were statistically significant in Norton 1996, favouring the PEG group and also the serum albumin change from baseline were statistically significant favouring PEG in Sadasivan 2012. Haemoglobin levels expressed as a change from baseline also were higher in the PEG group and this was a statistically significant in the only study that reported this outcome (Sadasivan 2012).\nOutcomes relating to quality of life, including the scores of patient satisfaction and inconvenience in maintaining the intervention by nurses as reported in Baeten 1992, were not statistically significant in favour of either PEG or NGT. Functional ability reported in Dennis 2005 favoured neither PEG nor NGT.\nAnalyses of time on enteral nutrition and length of hospital stay favoured neither PEG nor NGT. However, these analyses of time are very unlikely to follow a normal distribution, so the analyses of mean differences are not necessarily accurate.These results should\nbe interpreted cautiously as the assumption of normality for these outcomes may not be met.\nThese conclusions were not changed by the 2014 update of the review.",

      "content": "Based on the findings of this review, outcomes in participants who received nutritional support via a PEG may be more favourable that in those who have a NGT, especially for the outcome of intervention failure, based on an examination of 408 participants who had heterogeneous clinical and demographic characteristics.\nParticipants receiving PEG may be more likely to adhere to treatment at six weeks and six months. However, we found no evidence of a difference in mortality or adverse events (aspiration pneumonia) between the comparison groups. This non significant result does not imply no difference and we suggest that the review may not have had sufficient power to look at these less common events. Participants receiving PEG may experience less reflux oesophagitis (an adverse event). There is limited evidence, derived from single study results and small meta-analyses that PEG results in better outcomes in terms participants' nutritional status (mid-arm circumference, haemoglobin levels and serum albumin), and report better quality of life.\nWe found clinical heterogeneity between the studies and noted statistical heterogeneity in some of our analyses. For example, for our analyses of intervention failure, our primary outcome, we observed high levels of statistical heterogeneity resulting from the inclusion of the Baeten 1992 and Yata 2001 trials. One explanation for this may be the clinical heterogeneity between the trials, with the participants having different baseline diseases. We made a post-hoc decision to investigate the possible reasons for heterogeneity in the intervention failure meta-analysis as we assumed that the source of this statistical heterogeneity would be related to clinical heterogeneity. We hypothesised that baseline disease may have contributed to clinical heterogeneity and we categorised the studies by baseline disease, i.e. cerebrovascular event or neurological disorder versus mixed baseline disease (i.e. participants who may have had severe co-morbidities including cancer) and found that for the outcome of intervention failures in participants with cerebrovascular or neurological disease only, the results favoured PEG (i.e. fewer participants in the PEG group experienced any of the adverse events evaluated in the studies), but there was no difference between the groups for the mixed baseline disease subgroups and these studies included Baeten 1992 and Yata 2001. However, our hypothesis and the results of this analysis only point to one possible cause of heterogeneity, and this should be adequately tested in future studies. One further source of clinical heterogeneity in the remaining analyses could be because of the different techniques used to insert the PEG.\nMany of the studies reported continuous outcome data in a format that could not be incorporated in to our meta-analyses for example, median values. This limited the number of analyses that we could perform and we reported these data narratively in the review. Information reported in this way should be regarded as providing additional information only and the analyses we performed including meta-analysis, forest plots, tests for statistical heterogeneity provide more precise estimates of effects.",

      "content": "The findings of the present review of the literature should be interpreted with caution, given that almost half of the authors failed to report the method used to sequence and conceal the allocation (Figure 2; Figure 3). This is one of the main causes of error in randomised systematic studies. In addition, other potential risks of bias stemmed from the absence of prior planning of follow-up time, as well as the unpublished or high rates of losses during follow-up. However, almost all of the authors attempted to prevent attrition by making the flow of patients clear and through selective reporting bias by selecting clinically relevant outcomes. There are also challenges relating to the study design in terms of the numbers available for randomisation, following up such seriously ill patients and the high cost of the procedures in question. These factors may explain why the majority of studies involve small samples. It should be noted that all of the studies were judged at high risk of performance bias because it is not possible to blind participants and personnel in studies of this nature. In all cases of uncertainly we attempted to obtain further information or disaggregated data from the trial investigator, but where this was not available it was because the investigator no longer had access to historical trial data, or was unable to provide additional information. This systematic review of the literature is valuable in analysing 11 studies, thereby increasing the sample size to 735 participants. Nevertheless, further randomised clinical trials that adopt a rigorous method are warranted.\nWe rated the overall quality of the evidence as moderate or low for the key outcomes of treatment failure, mortality, pneumonia and adverse events (Summary of findings for the main comparison), resulting in lower confidence in the estimate of effect for those outcomes and further research is likely to have an important impact in our confidence in the estimate of effect and may even change the estimate. Where we downgraded the evidence, it was because there was risk of bias in the trial, out of eight estimates of potential bias (random sequence generation; allocation concealment; incomplete outcome data; selective reporting; blinding of participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assessment, and other bias) only six studies obtained scores of four or more. The included studies involved relatively few participants and wide confidence intervals (imprecision), although it is accepted that large scale studies of this type would be very difficult to perform. The results of many meta-analyses had high levels of statistical heterogeneity (inconsistency).",

However, combining the results of 11 different studies with \u2245 400 patients, it seems that the PEG option is associated with a lower risk of intervention failure. Given the importance of this finding, selecting PEG might reduce the difference in cost between the two procedures. The findings of all of the other studies included in this analysis seem to support the use of PEG. Guidelines suggest that PEG is a highly effective and safe procedure when modern equipment is used, established standards are followed (L\u00f6ser 2005). However, a careful patient selection and professional proficiency are fundamental for better outcomes (Blumenstein 2014; Skitt 2011). In a narrative review, Plonk 2005 suggested that the use of PEG should only be considered in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, intestinal blockage by malignant tumour with incoercible vomiting, persistent dysphagia after acute stroke, and early head and neck cancer. However, the results of a systematic review that included studies with different designs suggests that PEG and NGT have the same effectiveness and safety for patients with head and neck cancer, even considering relevant outcomes, such as mortality and nutritional status (Wang 2014). Although no study included in our systematic review made available information about the use of nasal looping technique, there is some evidence that such NGT technique has potential to be preferable over PEG (Anderson 2004).",

      "content": "Based on the findings of this meta-analysis, the results favoured PEG rather than NGT for intervention failure, but not for mortality and pneumonia rates, and other adverse events. There may be some advantage in terms of nutritional status in using PEG over NGT, and patients may report better quality of life when using a PEG tube.\nIn routine practice, however, the costs and benefits of both procedures should be taken into account. Some health service providers, particularly under the public health system, face difficulties acquiring endoscopic gastrostomy apparatus due to their high cost. Possible reasons for the current state of the research in this area include the high cost of the procedures in question. Corry 2008 provided an example of this stating that the \"cost of each feeding tube is $26 for a NGT and $110 for a PEG tube\" However, it is noteworthy that because nasogastric tubes are easier to introduce\n(more often by the nursing team) and less weight is placed on the cost of constantly changing them as stated in Corry 2008 \"The insertion costs are significantly different as the NGT are inserted by nursing staff in outpatients and the PEG tubes are inserted by surgeons in theatre. The cost for insertion of a NGT is $50 (includes nursing time and cost of chest X-ray), whereas the cost of insertion of a PEG tube is $626\". Therefore endoscopic gastrostomies may be less frequently indicated (Corry 2008).\nIt is important to note that in clinical practice, an endoscopic examination performed prior to PEG insertion is indicated in all cases, as the patient might present with lesions of the gastrointestinal tract, which prevents the passage of the endoscopy device and even tubes. In such patients, gastric tumours might also be present, which precludes gastrostomy. Partial gastric resections can also influence patients to elect to use alternative methods of enteral feeding.",

      "content": "Our systematic review of the current evidence, carried out in 2014, indicated that information is available on important outcomes such as intervention failure, mortality, pneumonia and adverse events. The included studies were carried out with participants with varying baseline diseases including neurological baseline diseases and those with malignancies. Future studies should provide adequate baseline information such as baseline disease, gender and age of the participants. The gastrostomy technique was described only in some of the included studies, and future researchers should ideally specify the technique used and the experience of the professionals involved to allow for the analysis of more specific subgroups. Data on the nutritional status of the patients would prove valuable, as would a cost/benefit analysis of the number of feeding tubes used. Quality-of-life measures provide useful information about patient important outcomes and may help explain differences in adherence to treatment.\nThe high cost of the procedures in question combined with the difficulties associated with the randomisation and long-term follow-up of patients and explain why the majority of studies examine a small number of participants. Nevertheless, we believe that further randomised clinical trials should be conducted with rigorous observation of internal validity. They should also include previously planned and executed follow-up periods.",
