It can improve lung function, exercise capacity, symptoms, quality of life, 1 and even survival. 2,3 However, endobronchial valve implantation also is associated with potential complications such as Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, hemoptysis, and valve dislocation. 4 Pneumothorax is one of the most common immediate complications of valve implantation.\nThe development of pneumothorax after valve implantation is complicated and different from other forms of pneumothorax. It usually develops as a result of rapid expansion of the adjacent lobe after complete atelectasis of the target lobe, which is associated with tension and tearing of the lung tissue or rupture of a bleb or bulla. Over the years, the pneumothorax rate has increased to 17.6% to 34.4% since the absence of collateral ventilation was identi fi ed as a key factor in the success of valve implantation and patients have been selected accordingly. 5 Several factors have been identi fi ed as predictive of pneumothorax, such as the Emphysema\nIndex (EI) of the adjacent lobe, the size of the adjacent lobe in relationship to the hemithorax, the predominant type of emphysema, 6 and pleural adhesions, 7 or are highly suspected as risk factors, such as complete fi ssures, homogeneous emphysema, and rapid onset of lobar atelectasis. 5 Treatment pathways for the management of pneumothorax are already established, although some of the recommendations, such as the stepwise approach for valve removal for pneumothorax, are based on expert consensus, rather than evidence. 5\nThe severity of a pneumothorax after intervention varies. 8 Pneumothorax ex vacuo describes a condition in which the acute collapse of the target lobe causes a sudden increase in negative intrapleural pressure, and gas and blood are drawn into the pleural space from the surrounding tissues. 5 These patients usually do not require a chest tube drainage and bene fi t greatly from the procedure. Pneumothorax after valve implantation in general was reported to have no negative effects on the survival of the patient. 9 The 4-year survival rate is even highest in patients with pneumothorax and complete lobar atelectasis (84.8%) compared with patients with complete lobar atelectasis without pneumothorax (73.1%). 2 However, severe forms of pneumothorax also can be accompanied by complete collapse of the lung and persistent air leak requiring further measures, such as valve removal, respiratory ventilation support, or surgical closure of the fi stula in the case of a parenchyma leakage. Deaths after severe pneumothorax also have been reported. 10,11\nClinical experience suggests that these patients with severe pneumothorax do not bene fi t from endobronchial valve implantation and even risk a worsening of the underlying disease. The aim of this study was to characterize different types of pneumothorax and their outcomes in a high-volume center for endoscopic lung volume reduction, paying particular attention to the event of severe pneumothorax.\n\n## tudy Design and Methods Study Overview\n\nThis study retrospectively analyzed all patients who underwent endobronchial valve implantation between January 2016 and May 2023 at a single center, speci fi cally those who demonstrated pneumothorax in the fi rst 3 months after the procedure. The diagnosis of pneumothorax was identi fi ed by International Classi fi cation of Diseases codes. The study was approved by the ethics\ncommittee of the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg (Identifi er: S-621/2023) and was in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki in its current version. All patients gave written informed consent for the scienti fi c use of their medical records.\n\n## alve Implantation and Pneumothorax Management\n\nPatient selection, endoscopic valve implantation, and management of pneumothorax were performed according to\n\n## ake-Home Points\n\nStudy Question: Can lessons still be learned from different severity grades of pneumothorax after endoscopic lung volume reduction with valves? Results: The incidence of pneumothorax depends on the location of the target lobe and fi ssure integrity. Severe pneumothorax with valve removal is associated with a poor outcome, and valve reimplantation after valve removal for pneumothorax carries a high risk of repeat pneumothorax.\nInterpretation: Patients need to be informed more individually about the risk of pneumothorax, and future research should focus on the prediction and prevention of severe pneumothorax.\nbest practice recommendations. 1,12 The details can be viewed in e-Appendix 1. We de fi ned mild pneumothorax as pneumothorax without the need for chest tube drainage; moderate pneumothorax as pneumothorax with need for chest tube drainage, but with valves in situ; and severe pneumothorax as pneumothorax with chest tube drainage, prolonged air leak, and subsequent valve removal. In case of prolonged air leak, 1 or 2 valves were removed in clinically stable patients (ie, partial valve removal). If this did not lead to closure of the fi stula, the remaining valves were removed in a second bronchoscopy (ie, sequential valve removal). In clinically unstable patients or those with large air leaks, all valves were removed immediately in 1 bronchoscopy (ie, immediate complete valve removal).\n\n## ata Collection\n\nThe following data were analyzed: EI and lung volumes (lung, hemithorax, contralateral hemithorax, target lobe, and adjacent lobe), obtained from the quantitative CT imaging software Yacta (in-house program of the University of Heidelberg) at 950 Houns fi eld units 13 ; fi ssure integrity (assessed by experienced radiologists); emphysema characteristics (paraseptal components, bullous emphysema, pleural adhesions, and others); perfusion scintigraphy; demographic data (age, sex, and former nicotine consumption in package years); BMI; lung function (FEV1, residual volume, vital capacity, and total lung capacity, all in liters and percentage); diffusion capacity (diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide [DLCO] and DLCO divided by the alveolar volume) in percentage; 6-minute walk distance; modifi ed Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Assessment Test results; extent and type of pneumothorax using radiography; multidetector CT imaging fi ndings and clinical assessment (pneumothorax ex vacuo or interlobar pneumothorax, mantle or extensive pneumothorax, or tension pneumothorax); management of pneumothorax (chest tube insertion, second chest tube, valve removal, and surgical parenchymal fi stula closure); and complications (subcutaneous emphysema, respiratory insuf fi ciency [need of additional oxygen, highfl ow oxygen therapy, noninvasive ventilation, and\ninvasive ventilation], antibiotic therapy, cortisone therapy, hemoptysis, death, and tachyarrhythmia).\nThe primary outcome was the 90-day follow-up after valve implantation and, in the case of valve removal and subsequent reimplantation, 90 days after reimplantation of valves. Therefore, lung function, exercise capacity, symptom scores, and atelectasis rate (based on evaluation of multidetector CT scan fi ndings: complete lobar atelectasis, lung volume reduction with partial atelectasis, no lung volume reduction) were assessed after 3 months.\n\n## tatistical Analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 27 (IBM Corporation). Data are presented as mean /C6 SD or median (interquartile range). Frequencies are presented as absolute numbers and percentages. Data such as pneumothorax characteristics and management, as well as the reimplantation of valves, are presented only descriptively.\nIn the group of patients without pneumothorax, only target lobes, fi ssure integrity, and Chartis results were assessed. For patients with pneumothorax, all of the mentioned basic characteristics were analyzed. Patients with and without pneumothorax were compared for fi ssure integrity, target lobes, and Chartis (Pulmonx Corporation) results. Patients with and without valve removal and with partial vs complete valve removal were compared for all basic characteristics, collateral ventilation, emphysema characteristics, perfusion, quantitative CT scan fi ndings, pneumothorax type, and complications. Comparisons were made by 2-sided Student t test for independent data or c 2 test for frequency data. Data between 90-day follow-up and baseline were compared by 2-sided Student t test for paired data, separately for patients with mild or moderate pneumothorax, patients with valve removal and subsequent reimplantation, and patients with valve removal without subsequent reimplantation.\nBecause of the exploratory nature of the study, P values were interpreted descriptively. No adjustment was made for multiple testing. P values of < .05 were considered statistically signi fi cant.\n\n## atient Flow Chart and Occurrence of Pneumothorax\n\nThe patient fl ow chart is presented in Figure 1. Three patients were excluded from this analysis because of incomplete data (pneumothorax occurred in another\nhospital) or pneumothorax after valve removal because of poststenotic pneumonia (n 1\u20444 2). The pneumothorax rate was 19% (102/532 patients).\nThe left lower lobe was the most common target lobe in the overall cohort of 532 patients (Table 1). The incidence of pneumothorax varied signi fi cantly for the\n]\ndifferent target lobes, with a higher incidence after valve placement in the upper lobes (31.3%) compared with the lower lobes (11.3%; P < .001), even when assessing only patients with complete fi ssures of 95% to 100% ( P < .001) (Figure 2).\nThe mean fi ssure integrity of 93.4 /C6 10.3% (median, 95.0%; interquartile range, 90.0%-100.0%) in patients without pneumothorax was signi fi cantly lower compared with 96.6 /C6 6.3% (median, 100.0%; interquartile range, 95.0%-100.0%) in patients with pneumothorax ( P 1\u20444 .002). Patients with pneumothorax more frequently demonstrated complete fi ssures (80.4%) compared with patients without pneumothorax (64.7%; P 1\u20444 .002). Only 2 patients with a fi ssure integrity of < 95% and a target in one of the lower lobes demonstrated pneumothorax (vs 18 patients with fi ssure integrity of < 95% and target in the upper lobes).\nChartis measurement was performed in 128 patients; 15 of these patients (11.7%) demonstrated pneumothorax. Forty-four patients showed a lowfl ow phenotype in Chartis measurement, of whom 2 patients demonstrated pneumothorax (both in the upper lobes, and none in the lower lobes).\n\n## neumothorax Cohort and Characteristics\n\nThe following results refer to the 102 patients with pneumothorax whose basic characteristics are shown in\nLLL 1\u20444 left lower lobe; LUL 1\u20444 left upper lobe; RLL 1\u20444 right lower lobe; RML 1\u20444 right middle lobe; RUL 1\u20444 right upper lobe.\nTable 2. This cohort also includes severely ill patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with FEV1 of < 20% (n 1\u20444 11), DLCO of < 20% (n 1\u20444 12), and 6-minute walk distance of < 100 m (n 1\u20444 10). A proportion of 38.2% of all patients showed speci fi c features of emphysema on multidetector CT imaging such as bullous emphysema, paraseptal distribution, or pleural adhesions, and 46.1% had heterogeneous emphysema with a mean target lobe EI of 48.0 /C6 14.5%.\nMost pneumothoraces (55.9%) occurred on the day of the procedure and 93.1% occurred within the fi rst 3 days after valve implantation. In 4 patients, pneumothorax occurred only 5, 0, 5, and 49 days after a second bronchoscopy for valve replacement and reimplantation after previous removal.\nTwentyfi ve patients (24.5%) demonstrated a tension pneumothorax. Chest tube drainage was required in 69.6% of all patients with pneumothorax (mean length of drainage, 9.0 /C6 4.6 days) and 20.6% of all patients with pneumothorax required a second drainage (mean length of drainage, 9.9 /C6 5.6 days). Subcutaneous emphysema was observed in 48.0% of all patients. The mean length of hospital stay was 13.0 /C6 9.0 days (minimum, 3 days; maximum, 56 days; 33.3% of all patients stayed > 14 days in hospital), and a second hospital stay was required in 4 patients.\nRespiratory failure developed in 41 patients (15 patients required highfl ow oxygen therapy, noninvasive ventilation, or both; 4 patients required invasive ventilation). Twenty-two patients were transferred to intensive care, and surgical fi stula closure was required in 9 patients. Further complications included hemoptysis, need for antibiotic therapy because of pneumonia, need for cortisone therapy because of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, and tachyarrhythmia in 2.9%, 29.6%, 3.9%, and 3.9% of patients, respectively. One patient died as a result of multiorgan failure after surgical fi stula closure with concomitant attempt for lung volume reduction and rupture of the left pulmonary artery.\n\n## evere Pneumothorax and Valve Reimplantation\n\nIn total, 30.4%, 30.4%, and 39.2% of all patients demonstrated mild, moderate, and severe pneumothorax, respectively. No statistically signi fi cant differences for basic characteristics, such as lung function or emphysema characteristics, could be identi fi ed for patients with mild and moderate pneumothorax vs severe pneumothorax. Signi fi cant\ndifferences were noted regarding the target lobe for occurrence of severe pneumothorax, with the highest incidence (55.1%) after valve placement in the left upper lobe (LUL). Furthermore, the target lobe was signi fi cantly more hyperin fl ated in patients with severe pneumothorax (2002.3 /C6 562.9 mL vs 1734.4 /C6 603.5 mL; P 1\u20444 .027) (Table 2). Patients with severe pneumothorax underwent a longer hospital stay (18.3 /C6 10.7 days vs 9.7 /C6 7.0 days; P < .001) and more often demonstrated respiratory insuf fi ciency (55% vs 30.6%; P 1\u20444 .013), subcutaneous emphysema (90% vs 21%; P < .001), and complications (hemoptysis; need for antibiotics, cortisone, or both; or tachyarrhythmia: 45% vs 21.0%; P 1\u20444 .010).\nValve removal was required in 40 patients. Two unusual cases of pneumothorax ex vacuo occurred that required chest tube placement and valve removal. One of these patients was discharged with pneumothorax ex vacuo, but a few days later, a chest tube was placed in an outside hospital, which worsened the patient ' s condition and led to valve removal in our hospital. A second patient with pneumothorax ex vacuo did not receive a chest tube, but valves were removed because progressive respiratory failure developed requiring noninvasive ventilation.\nPartial valve removal was performed in 26 patients, but was suf fi cient in only 46.2% patients (12/26). The remaining patients underwent sequential complete removal of the remaining valves. In 14 patients, immediate complete valve removal was required. The rate of repeat pneumothorax overall was 42.9% and was higher in the cohort with sequential valve removal (75%) than in the group with partial valve removal (30%). In 3 patients, de fi nitive complete valve removal was required after reimplantation and repeat pneumothorax (Figure 3).\nPatients with partial valve removal showed signi fi cantly better DLCO (33.4 /C6 9.3% vs 26.2 /C6 9.4%; P 1\u20444 .046), better 6-minute walk distance (297.4 /C6 92.6 m vs 216.0 /C6 108.7 m; P 1\u20444 .035), and lower EI of the contralateral lung (30.3 /C6 11.2% vs 39.7 /C6 10.3%; P 1\u20444 .014) at baseline than patients with either sequential or immediate complete valve removal.\n\n## ndoscopic Lung Volume Reduction Outcome\n\nAt the 90-day follow-up, data were available for 74 patients (e-Appendix 2). The loss to follow-up rates were 9.7%, 21.4%, and 73.1% for patients with mild or moderate pneumothorax, severe pneumothorax with subsequent reimplantation, and severe pneumothorax without valve reimplantation, respectively.\n]\n(Continued)\nPatients with mild or moderate pneumothorax experienced a statistically signi fi cant bene fi t in lung function (Table 3) with an atelectasis rate of 67.9%, as did\npatients with severe pneumothorax and subsequent valve reimplantation (66.7% atelectasis rate).

In total, 26 patients never underwent valve reimplantation. The patients without valve reimplantation experienced no statistically signi fi cant changes in lung function, exercise capacity, or symptom scores. Six of 102 patients subsequently were referred for lung volume reduction surgery.\n\n## iscussion\n\nThis retrospective analysis of 102 patients with pneumothorax after valve implantation revealed several fi ndings. Pneumothorax was more likely to occur with intact fi ssures and after valve placement in the upper lobes, particularly in the LUL. A lower risk of pneumothorax was observed in patients with an upfront Chartis measurement, especially if the lowfl ow phenotype was observed. A strati fi cation of pneumothorax by severity after occurrence seems to be useful, because patients with mild and moderate pneumothorax showed a high success rate of atelectasis, whereas the event of severe pneumothorax often was associated with complications and poor clinical outcome. In addition, valve reimplantation was associated with an increased risk of repeat pneumothorax.\nThe incidence of pneumothorax was signi fi cantly higher after valve placement in the upper lobes and highest after valve placement in the LUL in our study. The scienti fi c community has been uncertain whether valve placement in the upper lobes is associated with an increased risk of pneumothorax. 5 Gompelmann et al 6 could not show that\nupper target lobes were a predictor of pneumothorax, but only patients with a complete lobar atelectasis were analyzed in this study. Two previous trials from 2015 14 and 2016 15 con fi rmed the increased incidence of pneumothorax after valve placement in the LUL (29.4% and 30.1%, respectively). This means that when the LUL is occluded with valves, the adjacent left lower lobe does not expand suf fi ciently and tears. This may be because occlusion of a large LUL, which has more segments with the lingula than the right upper lobe, exerts more traction on the left lower lobe during closure. However, this fi nding needs further investigation.\nIn contrast, the increased occurrence of pneumothorax in complete fi ssures (without the need for Chartis measurement) is expected. It is well known that the Chartis measurement is not a 100% reliable method for assessing collateral ventilation and that the lowfl ow phenotype is a false-negative fi nding in 30.2% of all measurements. 16 Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that pneumothorax is less common in intermediate fi ssures where Chartis measurement is required and collateral ventilation may still be present. This study cannot answer whether the relative absence of pneumothorax in patients with a Chartis measurement also indicates a lower treatment bene fi t of valve implantation, but this should be investigated in the future.\nThe severe pneumothorax rate of 39.2% in this study was higher than reported in previous studies\n(Continued)\n(ie, 0%-11.6%), 5 most probably because of improved patient selection with a higher rate of complete fi ssures. Patients with severe pneumothorax had multiple complications and showed no long-term bene fi t from therapy; 1 patient even died. Whether their clinical condition and lung function may even deteriorate cannot be answered from our study, because many patients did not return for follow-up after valve removal. It is clear that only those patients with pneumothorax who keep their valves (or have them reimplanted) bene fi t. A high atelectasis rate was observed in these\npatients. This is in line with data from Gompelmann et al, 2 who showed that the 4-year survival rate was highest in patients with complete lobar atelectasis and pneumothorax (84.8%) compared with patients with complete lobar atelectasis without pneumothorax (73.1%), patients without atelectasis or pneumothorax (60.1%), and patients with pneumothorax without concomitant atelectasis (54.4%).\nOur study identi fi ed the size of the hyperin fl ated target lobe and valve placement in the LUL as potential risk\nData are presented as No. or mean /C6 SD.

In contrast, the Pulmonx Endobronchial Valves Used in Treatment of Emphysema (LIBERATE) study 11 showed that patients were at higher risk of so-called complex pneumothorax (de fi ned as death or complete valve removal) if the lobe with the highest destruction score was not treated and the EI of the untreated contralateral lung was > 60% (EI measured at -910 Houns fi eld units).\nTo our knowledge, this is the fi rst study to provide detailed data on the risk of repeat pneumothorax after valve reimplantation. Recurrence rates of 17% and 29% have been reported from 2 centers without details. 5 Valve reimplantation after removal for pneumothorax was associated with an increased risk of repeat pneumothorax in this cohort, especially when all valves had to be removed (75% risk of repeat pneumothorax). The decision for valve reimplantation therefore should be discussed critically with the patient, although it is dif fi cult to derive clinical recommendations from these few retrospective data.\nThe main limitation of this study is its retrospective nature. It represents a re fl ection of clinical practice, which is already adapted to expert consensus guidelines 5 and clinical experience with pneumothorax. A prospective evaluation of pneumothorax incidence and other speci fi c clinical scenarios in patients with a high risk of pneumothorax developing after valve (re)implantation (eg, those with bullous or paraseptal emphysema or those with complete immediate valve removal) in a randomized controlled study has severe ethical restrictions. Therefore, observational studies must continue to be conducted and used to verify previous assumptions about the development of pneumothorax. Another weakness of the study is that the basic cohort of all patients with valve implantation has not been characterized fully. Therefore, it is not possible to reliably predict (severe) pneumothorax from this study and to make further comparisons between patients with and without pneumothorax. The analysis of fi ssure integrity was carried out by experienced radiologists and not by quantitative CT imaging in our study. This may have limitations in the informative value of the fi ssure integrity, even if the results seem reliable.\nIn the future, studies including large cohorts with and without severe pneumothorax after valve implantation should come closer to predicting severe pneumothorax. Something like a score that can predict the occurrence of pneumothorax better, especially severe pneumothorax, and that can be used in daily clinical practice, certainly\nwould be helpful. Studies on the prevention of pneumothorax, such as the sequential valve implantation approach, 17 should concentrate on severe forms of pneumothorax in terms of cost-bene fi t analysis, because the prevention of mild pneumothoraces without the need for further invasive measures and with a good outcome does not seem to be necessary.\n\n## nterpretation\n\nThe data presented allow for a more accurate assessment of pneumothorax risk and for patients to be informed more individually about the expected risk of (severe) pneumothorax depending on the target lobe and fi ssure integrity. A categorization of the severity of pneumothorax, and in particular a distinction between severe pneumothorax and mild or moderate pneumothorax, seems to be useful for further studies and reporting, because severe pneumothorax is an enormous burden for the patient and is not associated with the same therapeutic success as mild and moderate pneumothorax. The possibility of valve reimplantation after complete valve removal resulting from severe pneumothorax should be discussed critically with the patient, because the risk of repeat pneumothorax is high. Although valve implantation has become a routine procedure in many hospitals, the complications of this procedure still need to be considered. Future research should focus on the prediction and prevention of severe forms of pneumothorax.\n\n## unding/Support\n\nThis work was supported by the Beatrice Gr\u00e4 fi n von Hardenberg-Stiftung, which funded staff for this study.\n\n## inancial/Non fi nancial Disclosures\n\nThe authors have reported to CHEST the following: J.

F. Herth, MD\nBACKGROUND: Pneumothorax is a major complication after endoscopic lung volume reduction with valves, with a prevalence of up to 34%. Although some patients bene fi t from valve implantation despite pneumothorax, others are signi fi cantly impaired after lung collapse.\nRESEARCH QUESTION: What are the differences in the severity grades of pneumothorax and how do these affect clinical practice?\nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This single-center retrospective study analyzed patients undergoing endoscopic valve implantation with and without pneumothorax after intervention. Emphysema characteristics, collateral ventilation, management, and outcome of patients with pneumothorax 3 months after valve implantation were assessed. Pneumothorax was categorized as severe (chest tube insertion, prolonged air leak requiring valve removal), moderate (chest tube, no valve removal), and mild (no chest tube).\nRESULTS: Pneumothorax occurred in 102 of 532 patients (19%) and was signi fi cantly more common after valve placement in the upper lobes (31.3%) compared with the lower lobes (11.3%; P < .001). Fissure integrity was signi fi cantly higher in patients with pneumothorax (mean, 96.6 /C6 6.3% vs 93.4 /C6 10.3%; P 1\u20444 .002). Of all pneumothoraces, 30.4% were mild, 30.4% were moderate, and 39.2% were severe. Severe pneumothorax caused multiple complications and prolonged hospitalization. Valve placement in the left upper lobe and a larger size of the target lobe were identi fi ed as risk factors for severe pneumothorax. Patients with pneumothorax demonstrated complete lobar atelectasis in > 60% as a sign of therapeutic success, but obviously only when valves could be left in place or reimplanted. However, valve reimplantation resulted in repeat pneumothorax in 42.9%.\nINTERPRETATION: Patients could be informed more individually about their risk of pneumothorax, which varies with target lobe location, fi ssure integrity, and reimplantation. The poor outcome and high complication rate of severe pneumothorax calls for future research into the prediction of severe pneumothorax.

It can improve lung function, exercise capacity, symptoms, quality of life, 1 and even survival. 2,3 However, endobronchial valve implantation also is associated with potential complications such as Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, hemoptysis, and valve dislocation. 4 Pneumothorax is one of the most common immediate complications of valve implantation.\nThe development of pneumothorax after valve implantation is complicated and different from other forms of pneumothorax. It usually develops as a result of rapid expansion of the adjacent lobe after complete atelectasis of the target lobe, which is associated with tension and tearing of the lung tissue or rupture of a bleb or bulla. Over the years, the pneumothorax rate has increased to 17.6% to 34.4% since the absence of collateral ventilation was identi fi ed as a key factor in the success of valve implantation and patients have been selected accordingly. 5 Several factors have been identi fi ed as predictive of pneumothorax, such as the Emphysema\nIndex (EI) of the adjacent lobe, the size of the adjacent lobe in relationship to the hemithorax, the predominant type of emphysema, 6 and pleural adhesions, 7 or are highly suspected as risk factors, such as complete fi ssures, homogeneous emphysema, and rapid onset of lobar atelectasis. 5 Treatment pathways for the management of pneumothorax are already established, although some of the recommendations, such as the stepwise approach for valve removal for pneumothorax, are based on expert consensus, rather than evidence. 5\nThe severity of a pneumothorax after intervention varies. 8 Pneumothorax ex vacuo describes a condition in which the acute collapse of the target lobe causes a sudden increase in negative intrapleural pressure, and gas and blood are drawn into the pleural space from the surrounding tissues. 5 These patients usually do not require a chest tube drainage and bene fi t greatly from the procedure. Pneumothorax after valve implantation in general was reported to have no negative effects on the survival of the patient. 9 The 4-year survival rate is even highest in patients with pneumothorax and complete lobar atelectasis (84.8%) compared with patients with complete lobar atelectasis without pneumothorax (73.1%). 2 However, severe forms of pneumothorax also can be accompanied by complete collapse of the lung and persistent air leak requiring further measures, such as valve removal, respiratory ventilation support, or surgical closure of the fi stula in the case of a parenchyma leakage. Deaths after severe pneumothorax also have been reported. 10,11\nClinical experience suggests that these patients with severe pneumothorax do not bene fi t from endobronchial valve implantation and even risk a worsening of the underlying disease. The aim of this study was to characterize different types of pneumothorax and their outcomes in a high-volume center for endoscopic lung volume reduction, paying particular attention to the event of severe pneumothorax.",

      "content": "This retrospective analysis of 102 patients with pneumothorax after valve implantation revealed several fi ndings. Pneumothorax was more likely to occur with intact fi ssures and after valve placement in the upper lobes, particularly in the LUL. A lower risk of pneumothorax was observed in patients with an upfront Chartis measurement, especially if the lowfl ow phenotype was observed. A strati fi cation of pneumothorax by severity after occurrence seems to be useful, because patients with mild and moderate pneumothorax showed a high success rate of atelectasis, whereas the event of severe pneumothorax often was associated with complications and poor clinical outcome. In addition, valve reimplantation was associated with an increased risk of repeat pneumothorax.\nThe incidence of pneumothorax was signi fi cantly higher after valve placement in the upper lobes and highest after valve placement in the LUL in our study. The scienti fi c community has been uncertain whether valve placement in the upper lobes is associated with an increased risk of pneumothorax. 5 Gompelmann et al 6 could not show that\nupper target lobes were a predictor of pneumothorax, but only patients with a complete lobar atelectasis were analyzed in this study. Two previous trials from 2015 14 and 2016 15 con fi rmed the increased incidence of pneumothorax after valve placement in the LUL (29.4% and 30.1%, respectively). This means that when the LUL is occluded with valves, the adjacent left lower lobe does not expand suf fi ciently and tears. This may be because occlusion of a large LUL, which has more segments with the lingula than the right upper lobe, exerts more traction on the left lower lobe during closure. However, this fi nding needs further investigation.\nIn contrast, the increased occurrence of pneumothorax in complete fi ssures (without the need for Chartis measurement) is expected. It is well known that the Chartis measurement is not a 100% reliable method for assessing collateral ventilation and that the lowfl ow phenotype is a false-negative fi nding in 30.2% of all measurements. 16 Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that pneumothorax is less common in intermediate fi ssures where Chartis measurement is required and collateral ventilation may still be present. This study cannot answer whether the relative absence of pneumothorax in patients with a Chartis measurement also indicates a lower treatment bene fi t of valve implantation, but this should be investigated in the future.\nThe severe pneumothorax rate of 39.2% in this study was higher than reported in previous studies\n(Continued)\n(ie, 0%-11.6%), 5 most probably because of improved patient selection with a higher rate of complete fi ssures. Patients with severe pneumothorax had multiple complications and showed no long-term bene fi t from therapy; 1 patient even died. Whether their clinical condition and lung function may even deteriorate cannot be answered from our study, because many patients did not return for follow-up after valve removal. It is clear that only those patients with pneumothorax who keep their valves (or have them reimplanted) bene fi t. A high atelectasis rate was observed in these\npatients. This is in line with data from Gompelmann et al, 2 who showed that the 4-year survival rate was highest in patients with complete lobar atelectasis and pneumothorax (84.8%) compared with patients with complete lobar atelectasis without pneumothorax (73.1%), patients without atelectasis or pneumothorax (60.1%), and patients with pneumothorax without concomitant atelectasis (54.4%).\nOur study identi fi ed the size of the hyperin fl ated target lobe and valve placement in the LUL as potential risk\nData are presented as No. or mean /C6 SD.

In contrast, the Pulmonx Endobronchial Valves Used in Treatment of Emphysema (LIBERATE) study 11 showed that patients were at higher risk of so-called complex pneumothorax (de fi ned as death or complete valve removal) if the lobe with the highest destruction score was not treated and the EI of the untreated contralateral lung was > 60% (EI measured at -910 Houns fi eld units).\nTo our knowledge, this is the fi rst study to provide detailed data on the risk of repeat pneumothorax after valve reimplantation. Recurrence rates of 17% and 29% have been reported from 2 centers without details. 5 Valve reimplantation after removal for pneumothorax was associated with an increased risk of repeat pneumothorax in this cohort, especially when all valves had to be removed (75% risk of repeat pneumothorax). The decision for valve reimplantation therefore should be discussed critically with the patient, although it is dif fi cult to derive clinical recommendations from these few retrospective data.\nThe main limitation of this study is its retrospective nature. It represents a re fl ection of clinical practice, which is already adapted to expert consensus guidelines 5 and clinical experience with pneumothorax. A prospective evaluation of pneumothorax incidence and other speci fi c clinical scenarios in patients with a high risk of pneumothorax developing after valve (re)implantation (eg, those with bullous or paraseptal emphysema or those with complete immediate valve removal) in a randomized controlled study has severe ethical restrictions. Therefore, observational studies must continue to be conducted and used to verify previous assumptions about the development of pneumothorax. Another weakness of the study is that the basic cohort of all patients with valve implantation has not been characterized fully. Therefore, it is not possible to reliably predict (severe) pneumothorax from this study and to make further comparisons between patients with and without pneumothorax. The analysis of fi ssure integrity was carried out by experienced radiologists and not by quantitative CT imaging in our study. This may have limitations in the informative value of the fi ssure integrity, even if the results seem reliable.\nIn the future, studies including large cohorts with and without severe pneumothorax after valve implantation should come closer to predicting severe pneumothorax. Something like a score that can predict the occurrence of pneumothorax better, especially severe pneumothorax, and that can be used in daily clinical practice, certainly\nwould be helpful. Studies on the prevention of pneumothorax, such as the sequential valve implantation approach, 17 should concentrate on severe forms of pneumothorax in terms of cost-bene fi t analysis, because the prevention of mild pneumothoraces without the need for further invasive measures and with a good outcome does not seem to be necessary.",

The possibility of valve reimplantation after complete valve removal resulting from severe pneumothorax should be discussed critically with the patient, because the risk of repeat pneumothorax is high. Although valve implantation has become a routine procedure in many hospitals, the complications of this procedure still need to be considered.
