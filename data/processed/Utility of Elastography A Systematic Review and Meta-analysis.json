It is also ef fi cacious to evaluate mediastinal lymphadenopathy of unclear etiology. 1 During the endosonographic evaluation of lymph nodes, speci fi c B mode ultrasound characteristics, lymph node size, and power Doppler vascular patterns have been studied for prediction of malignant lymph node involvement. 2 -4 However, these characteristics are not sensitive, and assessment is dependent on operator expertise. Individual nodes may be avascular, and B mode features are often equivocal. 5 Imaging modalities, such as PET-CT scanning, have poor sensitivity and lack speci fi city for malignant mediastinal lymph node involvement. 6 During Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, multistation node involvement or multiple nodes at a single station is commonly observed.

Elastography has also been described as computer-assisted palpation. 9 After the development of technology to image elasticity in 1991, elastography was fi rst used for the characterization of malignant breast lesions. 10,11 Subsequently, use was described in the pancreas and thyroid nodules. A harder tissue, like one in fi ltrated by malignancy, is stiffer and less deformable. The hardness is analyzed as a color-based output that is interpreted in different methods based on the equipment. Before Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, elastography had been used in endoscopy-ultrasound (EUS)FNA for differentiation between benign and malignant abdominal lymphadenopathy. 12\nThe fi rst feasibility study of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was reported in 2013. 9 Since then, various methods of elastography assessment have been described. These broadly include 2 categories: qualitative and quantitative methods. The most commonly described method of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography categorized the elastography images into 3 patterns. This method divides elastography images into 3 color patterns, as de fi ned by Izumo et al 5 : (type 1) predominant nonblue, (type 2) part blue part nonblue, and (type 3) predominantly blue. Hard tissue like malignancy displays mostly blue color, whereas softer tissues like benign lesions display mainly nonblue (redgreen) color. Other qualitative methods include a 4-color or 5-color classi fi cation on similar principles. The later-described quantitative methods include the strain ratio (SR), blue color proportion (BCP), stiff area ratio (SAR), and strain histogram methods. 8,13 -15\nA meta-analysis reported the fi ndings from 7 published studies on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography. 16 Many other recent studies have reported variable sensitivity and speci fi city of elastography. The studies have methodological variability and have used different measures for reporting diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to summarize the studies describing the utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography. We also carried out a metaanalysis to calculate the pooled sensitivity and speci fi city of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography. We also carried out summary receiver operating curve (SROC)\nanalysis and meta-regression to study the effect of various characteristics affecting the sensitivity and speci fi city.\n\n## earch Strategy and Initial Review\n\nTwo authors (K.M. and M.M.) performed a systematic search of 2 databases: PubMed and EMBASE (January 1, 2004 up to July 30, 2020) to identify the original, peer-reviewed, full-length, human participant articles describing the use of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography. The following databasespeci fi c Boolean search strategy was used. Free text search terms were (Endobronchial ultrasound (ebus) OR Endobronchial ultrasound (ebus)-tbna OR Endobronchial ultrasound (ebus) tbna OR tbna OR endobronchial ultrasound OR endobronchial ultrasonography OR endobronchial ultrasound-guided OR endobronchial ultrasoundguided) AND (elastography OR elastographic). All the retrieved studies were imported into reference management software (EndNote). Duplicate citations were discarded. The studies were screened by title and abstract. Full texts were downloaded for review, wherever required. The reference lists of the extracted studies were also reviewed, and the authors also searched their fi les. The fi nally selected studies were independently screened by 2 authors (K.M. and M.M). Studies on utilization of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography for differentiation between malignant and benign mediastinal lymphadenopathy were included. For inclusion, suf fi cient data for calculating sensitivity, speci fi city, positive likelihood ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were required. The following studies were excluded: (a) studies that did not report the utilization of elastography in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA; (b) utilization of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA without elastography or vice versa; (c) elastography in EUS; (d) studies not in the English language; (e) review articles, editorials, abstracts, and letters without any case description; and (f) case reports or series with ten or fewer patients. Any disagreement between the authors was resolved after mutual discussion.\n\n## ata Abstraction\n\nData from the fi nally selected studies were abstracted on a data extraction form. The following information was retrieved after a thorough review of the full text: (a) author, (b) year, (c) number of patients, (d) sex, (e) number of centers, (f) study design, (g) age, (h) Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope type, (i) anesthesia, (j) number of nodes sampled, (k) ultrasound processor and scanning frequency, (l) elastographic classi fi cation system used\n(quantitative or qualitative) and number of interpreters, (m) suction use, (n) rapid on-site evaluation, (o) lymph node size, (p) lymph node stations sampled, (q) needle gauge, (r) diagnostic comparators, (s) true positives, (t) false negatives, (u) false positives (FP), and (v) true negatives. The sensitivity, speci fi city, positive and negative predictive values, diagnostic accuracy, PLR, and NLR and DOR were calculated manually individually for each study and cross-checked with the author reported values. The systematic review methodology is summarized in Figure 1.\n\n## ssessment of Study Quality\n\nThe Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool was used to assess the quality of studies. Two authors (M.M. and H.I.) evaluated the quality of the selected studies for meta-analysis. The interobserver agreement for the quality assessment of the selected studies was determined.\n\n## tatistical Analysis\n\nStatistical analyses were carried out using the STATA statistical analysis software (Stata Statistical Software: Release 15, 2017; StataCorp LLC,\n\n## able 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Study Participants, Study Design, and Technical Details of the EBUS-TBNA Procedure\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The standard guidelines for carrying out a meta-analysis of a diagnostic test were followed and the required items in the PRISMA checklist were addressed. 17 Data were imported into a 2-by-2 table and initially analyzed manually. The program calculated summary estimates of sensitivity and speci fi city [with 95% con fi dence intervals (CIs)] after antilogit transformation of the mean logit sensitivity and logit speci fi city with respective SEs considering the heterogeneity between studies. Results were expressed as sensitivity, speci fi city, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and likelihood ratios. A binary random-effects model was then constructed. In Stata, several summary receiver operating curve (ROC) linear regression lines based on either the regression of logit sensitivity on speci fi city, the regression of logit speci fi city on sensitivity, or an orthogonal regression line by minimizing the perpendicular distances may be derived, based on parameters estimated by the bivariate model. These lines can be transformed back into the original ROC scale to obtain a summary ROC. We reported the overall sensitivity and speci fi city of endobronchial ultrasonographic elastography, and the results were expressed as a percentage and CI. We also carried out a sensitivity and speci fi city analysis (meta-regression) across various subgroups to assess the in fl uence of baseline characteristics on heterogeneity.\n\n## eterogeneity Assessment\n\nThe impact of heterogeneity on the pooled estimates of the outcome was assessed using the Cochran Q statistic and the I 2 test. I 2 is the traditional statistical tool to evaluate the impact of unobserved heterogeneity. 18 It describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is attributable to heterogeneity rather than chance. An I 2 value of \u2265 50% indicates signi fi cant heterogeneity. For the Cochran Q test, which has a low sensitivity for detecting heterogeneity, a P -value < 0.1 was signi fi cant for the presence of statistical heterogeneity.\n\n## ssessment of Publication Bias\n\nPublication bias was assessed using Deek funnel plot (statistically signi fi cant publication bias when P < 0.1). 19\n\n## ESULTS\n\nThe initial literature search yielded 90 articles, from which 20 studies were selected for data abstraction and included in the meta-analysis. One study on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was excluded\ndue to lack of suf fi cient information to verify and extract the true positive, FP, false negative, and true negative values required for summary statistics of diagnostic accuracy. 20\n\n## escription of Studies and Quality Assessment\n\nThe study and procedural characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Overall, the 20 studies described Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography performance on 1600 patients (males 1055, 65.9%), with 2712 lymph nodes sampled overall. The methodological quality of the studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool is summarized in Table 2.\nTwelve studies (60%) were prospective and 8 (40%) were retrospective. 18 (90%) were single center [except Korrungruang and Boonsarngsuk 23 (2 centers) and Verhoeven et al 32 (5 centers)]. In 11 studies (55%), mild to deep sedation was used, 4 (20%) used general anesthesia (GA), and in one, use of both sedation and GA (5%) was described for performing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. The majority of studies used the Olympus Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope (13, 65%). A scanning frequency of 7.5 MHz was most commonly used. The rest of the equipment and procedure-related data are summarized in Table 1. The most frequently sampled lymph node stations were subcarinal (station 7) and lower right paratracheal (Station 4R). Rapid on-site evaluation was\navailable in 12 (60%) studies and a 22 G needle (100%) was used in all studies, where needle-use data were reported.\nEight studies reported the use of both qualitative and quantitative parameters for analysis of elastography images. Six studies each reported the use of only a single quantitative or qualitative parameter alone for elastography assessment (Table 3). For primary reporting and the metaanalysis, the most accurate parameter reported by the authors was used for summary statistics (10 qualitative and 10 quantitative). Among the qualitative methods, the 3-color classi fi cation system (type 1, 2, 3) was used most commonly. Other qualitative methods included either a 4-color or 5-color code pattern. The most used parameter for quantitative assessment was SR. Percentage of hard areas or BCP, SAR or blue pixel ratio, and strain histogram were the other quantitative methods described. The median number of elastography performers/interpreters in the studies was 2 (interquartile range: 1 to 2).\n\n## eta-analysis\n\nThe overall pooled sensitivity and speci fi city of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography were 0.90 (95% CI, 0.840.94) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73-0.84), respectively (Figure 2). SROC analysis showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90 (0.88-0.93) (Figure 3).\n-indicates high risk of bias; +, low risk of no bias; ?, unclear.\n\n## able 3.

These values for overall assessment and individual methods are summarized in Table 4. The SROC analysis for individual methods is shown in Figure 3. The AUC for elastography (overall), the 3-color pattern (type 3 vs. type 1), SR, and SAR were 0.90, 0.91, 0.83, and 0.86, respectively. The color classi fi cation method, as described by Izumo and colleagues (type 3 malignant vs. type 1 benign), had the highest AUC among the individual methods [AUC 0.91 (0.88-0.93)], whereas the SR had the lowest AUC, 0.83 (0.80-0.86) (Table 4, Figure 3).\n\n## eterogeneity Assessment and Publication Bias\n\nSigni fi cant heterogeneity was present in the sensitivity and speci fi city [ I 2 = 86.08 (95% CI, 80.93-91.23) for sensitivity, I 2 = 91.75 (95% CI, 89.13-94.38) for speci fi city]. There was evidence of publication bias, Deek funnel plot ( P = 0.01) (Figure 4).\n\n## ubgroup Analysis\n\nMeta-regression was performed to study the possible source of heterogeneity. The analysis was carried out to assess the in fl uence of the following characteristics:: number of patients, number of lymph nodes, study design, sedation versus GA, type of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) scope, and type of elastography (qualitative vs. quantitative). The number of patients and number of lymph nodes analyzed had an in fl uence on the heterogeneity in sensitivity and speci fi city (Figure 5). Studies that used GA and those that were retrospective in fl uenced the heterogeneity in speci fi city. Borderline signi fi cance was also observed for in fl uence on speci fi city using the Olympus Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope (Figure 5). Subgroup analyses did not show any difference in sensitivity and speci fi city between the qualitative and quantitative elastography methods (Table 5).\n\n## ISCUSSION\n\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography is a useful modality for differentiating between benign and\nmalignant mediastinal lymph nodes during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. The pooled diagnostic sensitivity and speci fi city of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography were 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73-0.84), respectively. Signi fi cant heterogeneity in sensitivity ( I 2 = 86.08, Q = 136.48, P < 0.01) and speci fi city ( I 2 = 91.75, Q = 230.43, P < 0.01) was observed. Subgroup analyses strongly suggested that the number of patients strongly in fl uenced the sensitivity, while the number of lymph nodes studied, GA, and retrospective study design in fl uenced the heterogeneity in speci fi city. There was no difference between the sensitivity and speci fi city of qualitative versus quantitative methods of elastography assessment.\nThe elastographic classi fi cation of lymph nodes into 3 color types, type 1 (predominantly nonblue pattern), type 2 (part blue and part nonblue pattern), and type 3 (predominantly blue pattern), is the most frequently described method on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography\n(8 of the 20 published studies). 5 This method is qualitative and operator dependent. The blue pattern signi fi ed a hard node with a higher probability of malignancy. In this meta-analysis, the Izumo method (type 3 vs. type 1 for malignancy) demonstrated the highest AUC among all techniques. In the initial study, there was also a good correlation between FDG-PET SUVmax and the color classi fi cations. 5 However, a signi fi cant drawback of this method is that the type 2 pattern is not included in diagnostic comparison (only type 3 was compared with type 1 for malignancy). 5,7,22,25,28,31 This choice leaves a large proportion of lymph nodes (part blue part nonblue) as unclassi fi ed and does not add to clinical decisions. A large percentage of nodes in real-life settings will not fi t into either a type 3 or type 1 pattern. Despite the high AUC, potential limitations of the method have been highlighted. Fournier et al 25 found a 23% prevalence of malignancy in type 1 nodes. Two of the 8 studies analyzed the data, including the type 2\npattern, in which type 3 was considered malignant, while type 1/type 2 was deemed to be benign for calculations. 27,33 However, this comparison was associated with reduced sensitivity. Two studies used a 5-color group classi fi cation. 24,29 Increasing the color groups increases subjectivity and decreases reproducibility. Another major limitation of color classifi cation is the probability of fi brotic lymph nodes (like post TB nodes) to appear as blue. 24 This overlap may signi fi cantly affect elastography interpretation in populations with a high prevalence of granulomatous conditions such as TB, sarcoidosis, and anthracosis. 22,35,36\nThe SR is the most reported (4 studies) quantitative elastography method. 13,21,23,30 However, this method has considerable heterogeneity in the cutoffs used and is one of the most variable parameters. 31 Also, there is ambiguity in the perinodal area to be selected for its calculation. Cutoff values ranging from 2.47 to 32.07 are described, yielding variable sensitivity, speci fi city, and diagnostic accuracy. In our meta-analysis, this method had the least AUC among the most commonly used methods. The method of selection of areas for SR is not standardized; therefore, this is subject to heavy operator bias. Although operators have attempted to minimize the error by taking a mean of multiple readings for the SR, this still does not take care of the area of selection. The second most frequently described method (3 studies) is the SAR [stiff areas as blue pixels (145 to 180 pixel area)/ lymph node area as ROI pixels]. 8,26,34 However, this requires another image analysis software (Image J) to calculate the stiff (blue) areas. It requires obtaining JPEG images or video clips for the software. Addition of another software for image analysis increases the procedure complexity, increasing the reporting times, and this impacts the real-life clinical utility of this method. 8 One study used a BCP based on a similar principle, but the software (Photoshop CS5) for the purpose was different. A multicenter study and a previous publication by 1 group explored the strain histogram method (2 studies) based on the mean strain. 15,32 However, the cutoffs of the mean strain in the 2 studies were different. A combination of mean strain, node size, and PET-CT fi ndings improved accuracy. In this method, examined lymph node showed elastography color dispersion in the ROI and provided the mean tissue elasticity. The blue color corresponded to a value of 0 and red color corresponded to a value of 255. Lymph nodes with more strain were suggestive of benignity and showed histograms with higher mean strain values.\nHowever, this method showed low diagnostic accuracy as compared with the other methods. The frequency histograms and blue proportion are less variable ( < 10%) than the SR (30.8%). 31 Qualitative versus quantitative method did not in fl uence the heterogeneity in sensitivity in our meta-analysis. Both methods have been found to be comparable in some studies where both techniques were used. 23\nAll the described methods of elastography have signi fi cant limitations. As has been reported by various authors, the high negative and positive predictive values of elastography do not underscore the need to obtain tissue for a de fi nitive diagnosis. The technology may aid in choosing a node for sampling if multiple nodes are involved, for selecting a speci fi c area for sampling, and to reduce the number of passes. 21 Despite these limitations, data indicate that elastographic features are more sensitive than B mode ultrasound features alone. Ideally, a combination of elastography with B mode features gives a superior diagnostic accuracy. 7,21,26 Lin et al 28 also observed that B mode features such as central necrosis in fl uence the accuracy of elastography for malignancy. Increased speci fi city and PPV for malignancy have also been reported when elastography is combined with PET-CT. 30\nOverall, the analysis found an NLR of 0.12, which indicates that the test could reasonably exclude malignancy when it is negative. However,\nthe PLR is 4.3 (usually an LR+ > 10 is associated with a large and signi fi cant increase in disease probability with a positive test result), thereby indicating the possibility of FP results. Hence, the pooled estimates are not strong enough to replace the actual sampling of the lymph nodes. Even with relatively high speci fi city and sensitivity, the PLR is low, making this test prone to FP results. In the common scenario where Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is being performed to diagnose or stage a lung cancer, the information that this test provides will not change the bronchoscopists ' choice of which lymph nodes to biopsy. There are certain limitations in this meta-analysis. Only 1 parameter was included per study for pooled analysis. Second, the pooled data have signi fi cant heterogeneity in terms of the diagnostic cutoffs and the gold standard. The elastography procedure itself has inherent limitations such as the amount of pressure used while generating the images, the selection of the perinodal area for estimation of SR, and multiple components of subjective interpretation. We did not publish the metaanalysis protocol in advance. In systematic reviews and meta-analysis, it may be useful to compare the outcomes reported in the manuscript against those in the protocol to check for outcome reporting bias. However, we did not observe deviations from the preplanned analyses.\n\n## imitations of Existing Elastography Technology and Implications for Future Research\n\nAlthough the results of the meta-analysis support the utility of elastography during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, the current technology has many limitations. Future\nresearch should focus on the re fi nements in this technology. Ideally, such a modality to assist in the prediction of a possible intranodal pathology should be operator independent. This bias is one of the most critical limitations of current technology. The\nwww.bronchology.com | 31\nCopyright r 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

A standard algorithm across manufacturers may be ideal.\nAs there was a possible effect of the method of sedation on speci fi city, a standardized protocol should be used for the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA procedure. Elastography fi ndings are likely to be affected by a coughing or a lightly sedated patient as compared with an immobile comfortable fi eld. The results should be available in real time to the operator without the delay of image processing using additional software. Most of the studies on elastography are single-center studies with a speci fi c patient pro fi le. Many have included only lung cancer and excluded the other conditions. Prospective multicenter studies, including a variety of disease conditions, with large sample sizes are required for validation. None of the studies has evaluated the elastography characteristics during EUS-B-FNA, and future research should also include this. The protocol for selecting an ROI should preferably be automated as this is a signi fi cant cause for heterogeneity in calculations. Also, apart from lung cancer, other malignant causes of lymphadenopathy should be validated. The consistency of performance at all lymph node stations needs to be con fi rmed. Some authors have described dif fi culty at the 4R station, especially in patients with mediastinal fat. The protocol should work on dynamic images rather than a static protocol so that it is not an individual static image, but a composite of pictures that are interpreted. One of the arguments made in favor of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography is the potential to save time by selecting out the likely benign lymph nodes and limiting the number of stations that need to be biopsied. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is not necessarily a time-consuming procedure and even a full mediastinal survey can be conducted in a reasonable amount of time. 37\nFinally, the validation against a surgical gold standard will be ideal in nondiagnostic EBUSTBNA. Many studies included the results of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA as the gold standard, which is not appropriate for validation of new technology. Prediction models may need to be created incorporating the clinical and imaging data to improve the diagnostic accuracy.\nThe data presented in the meta-analysis highlight the need for more standardization in terms of technology to improve test discrimination and limit operator dependence. The results do not support any change in standard clinical practice. In the current\nform, standalone elastography may not be suf fi cient to exclude malignancy or con fi rm benignity.\n\n## ONCLUSIONS\n\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography is a noninvasive modality with good overall diagnostic accuracy for differentiating benign and malignant intrathoracic lymph nodes. However, the present technology has many limitations and lack of generalizability. Future research should focus on further re fi nements and creation of novel analytic models of this potentially useful and exciting technology.\n\n## EFERENCES\n\n1. Madan K, Mohan A, Ayub II, et al.

Pandey, MD, \u2021 and Randeep Guleria, MD, DM*\nBackground: Ultrasound elastography noninvasively estimates tissue hardness. Studies have evaluated elastography for differentiating malignant from benign lymph nodes during endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration. Several methods of performing elastography are described with variable diagnostic accuracy.\nMethods: The aim of this study was to evaluate endobronchial ultrasound-guided elastography in differentiating malignant from benign mediastinal lymphadenopathy. We performed a systematic search of the PubMed and Embase databases to extract the relevant studies. A diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis was carried out to calculate the pooled sensitivity and speci fi city [with 95% con fi dence intervals (CIs)], and positive and negative likelihood ratios of elastography.\nResults: After a systematic search, 20 studies (1600 patients, 2712 nodes) were selected. The pooled sensitivity and speci fi city of elastography were 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73-0.84), respectively. The summary receiver operating curve demonstrated an area under the curve for elastography of 0.90 (0.88-0.93). The positive and negative likelihood ratios and the diagnostic odds ratio were\n4.3 (95% CI, 3.3-5.5), 0.12 (95% CI, 0.07-0.20), and 35 (95% CI, 19-63), respectively. Of the most commonly described methods, the color classi fi cation method (type 3 malignant vs. type 1 benign) demonstrated the highest area under the curve of 0.91 (0.88-0.93). There was signi fi cant heterogeneity and publication bias. Subgroup analyses indicated no signi fi cant difference between the sensitivity and speci fi city of quantitative and qualitative elastography methods.\nConclusions: Ultrasound elastography is useful in differentiating malignant and benign lymph nodes during endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration. However, elastography does not replace the requirement of lymph node aspiration.\nKey Words: endobronchial ultrasound, elastography, lung cancer, bronchoscopy, ultrasound, meta-analysis\n( J Bronchol Intervent Pulmonol 2022;29:18 -33)\nE ndobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA) is a wellestablished modality for the diagnosis and staging of non-small-cell lung cancer. It is also ef fi cacious to evaluate mediastinal lymphadenopathy of unclear etiology. 1 During the endosonographic evaluation of lymph nodes, speci fi c B mode ultrasound characteristics, lymph node size, and power Doppler vascular patterns have been studied for prediction of malignant lymph node involvement. 2 -4 However, these characteristics are not sensitive, and assessment is dependent on operator expertise. Individual nodes may be avascular, and B mode features are often equivocal. 5 Imaging modalities, such as PET-CT scanning, have poor sensitivity and lack speci fi city for malignant mediastinal lymph node involvement. 6 During Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, multistation node involvement or multiple nodes at a single station is commonly observed. Under these circumstances, the operator needs to identify the potentially malignant\nDOI: 10.1097/LBR.0000000000000781 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Elastography has also been described as computer-assisted palpation. 9 After the development of technology to image elasticity in 1991, elastography was fi rst used for the characterization of malignant breast lesions. 10,11 Subsequently, use was described in the pancreas and thyroid nodules. A harder tissue, like one in fi ltrated by malignancy, is stiffer and less deformable. The hardness is analyzed as a color-based output that is interpreted in different methods based on the equipment. Before Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, elastography had been used in endoscopy-ultrasound (EUS)FNA for differentiation between benign and malignant abdominal lymphadenopathy. 12\nThe fi rst feasibility study of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was reported in 2013. 9 Since then, various methods of elastography assessment have been described. These broadly include 2 categories: qualitative and quantitative methods. The most commonly described method of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography categorized the elastography images into 3 patterns. This method divides elastography images into 3 color patterns, as de fi ned by Izumo et al 5 : (type 1) predominant nonblue, (type 2) part blue part nonblue, and (type 3) predominantly blue. Hard tissue like malignancy displays mostly blue color, whereas softer tissues like benign lesions display mainly nonblue (redgreen) color. Other qualitative methods include a 4-color or 5-color classi fi cation on similar principles. The later-described quantitative methods include the strain ratio (SR), blue color proportion (BCP), stiff area ratio (SAR), and strain histogram methods. 8,13 -15\nA meta-analysis reported the fi ndings from 7 published studies on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography. 16 Many other recent studies have reported variable sensitivity and speci fi city of elastography. The studies have methodological variability and have used different measures for reporting diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to summarize the studies describing the utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography. We also carried out a metaanalysis to calculate the pooled sensitivity and speci fi city of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography. We also carried out summary receiver operating curve (SROC)\nanalysis and meta-regression to study the effect of various characteristics affecting the sensitivity and speci fi city.",

The methodological quality of the studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool is summarized in Table 2.\nTwelve studies (60%) were prospective and 8 (40%) were retrospective. 18 (90%) were single center [except Korrungruang and Boonsarngsuk 23 (2 centers) and Verhoeven et al 32 (5 centers)]. In 11 studies (55%), mild to deep sedation was used, 4 (20%) used general anesthesia (GA), and in one, use of both sedation and GA (5%) was described for performing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. The majority of studies used the Olympus Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope (13, 65%). A scanning frequency of 7.5 MHz was most commonly used. The rest of the equipment and procedure-related data are summarized in Table 1. The most frequently sampled lymph node stations were subcarinal (station 7) and lower right paratracheal (Station 4R). Rapid on-site evaluation was\navailable in 12 (60%) studies and a 22 G needle (100%) was used in all studies, where needle-use data were reported.\nEight studies reported the use of both qualitative and quantitative parameters for analysis of elastography images. Six studies each reported the use of only a single quantitative or qualitative parameter alone for elastography assessment (Table 3). For primary reporting and the metaanalysis, the most accurate parameter reported by the authors was used for summary statistics (10 qualitative and 10 quantitative). Among the qualitative methods, the 3-color classi fi cation system (type 1, 2, 3) was used most commonly. Other qualitative methods included either a 4-color or 5-color code pattern. The most used parameter for quantitative assessment was SR. Percentage of hard areas or BCP, SAR or blue pixel ratio, and strain histogram were the other quantitative methods described.

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography is a useful modality for differentiating between benign and\nmalignant mediastinal lymph nodes during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. The pooled diagnostic sensitivity and speci fi city of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography were 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73-0.84), respectively. Signi fi cant heterogeneity in sensitivity ( I 2 = 86.08, Q = 136.48, P < 0.01) and speci fi city ( I 2 = 91.75, Q = 230.43, P < 0.01) was observed. Subgroup analyses strongly suggested that the number of patients strongly in fl uenced the sensitivity, while the number of lymph nodes studied, GA, and retrospective study design in fl uenced the heterogeneity in speci fi city. There was no difference between the sensitivity and speci fi city of qualitative versus quantitative methods of elastography assessment.\nThe elastographic classi fi cation of lymph nodes into 3 color types, type 1 (predominantly nonblue pattern), type 2 (part blue and part nonblue pattern), and type 3 (predominantly blue pattern), is the most frequently described method on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography\n(8 of the 20 published studies). 5 This method is qualitative and operator dependent. The blue pattern signi fi ed a hard node with a higher probability of malignancy. In this meta-analysis, the Izumo method (type 3 vs. type 1 for malignancy) demonstrated the highest AUC among all techniques. In the initial study, there was also a good correlation between FDG-PET SUVmax and the color classi fi cations. 5 However, a signi fi cant drawback of this method is that the type 2 pattern is not included in diagnostic comparison (only type 3 was compared with type 1 for malignancy). 5,7,22,25,28,31 This choice leaves a large proportion of lymph nodes (part blue part nonblue) as unclassi fi ed and does not add to clinical decisions. A large percentage of nodes in real-life settings will not fi t into either a type 3 or type 1 pattern. Despite the high AUC, potential limitations of the method have been highlighted. Fournier et al 25 found a 23% prevalence of malignancy in type 1 nodes. Two of the 8 studies analyzed the data, including the type 2\npattern, in which type 3 was considered malignant, while type 1/type 2 was deemed to be benign for calculations. 27,33 However, this comparison was associated with reduced sensitivity. Two studies used a 5-color group classi fi cation. 24,29 Increasing the color groups increases subjectivity and decreases reproducibility. Another major limitation of color classifi cation is the probability of fi brotic lymph nodes (like post TB nodes) to appear as blue. 24 This overlap may signi fi cantly affect elastography interpretation in populations with a high prevalence of granulomatous conditions such as TB, sarcoidosis, and anthracosis. 22,35,36\nThe SR is the most reported (4 studies) quantitative elastography method. 13,21,23,30 However, this method has considerable heterogeneity in the cutoffs used and is one of the most variable parameters. 31 Also, there is ambiguity in the perinodal area to be selected for its calculation. Cutoff values ranging from 2.47 to 32.07 are described, yielding variable sensitivity, speci fi city, and diagnostic accuracy. In our meta-analysis, this method had the least AUC among the most commonly used methods. The method of selection of areas for SR is not standardized; therefore, this is subject to heavy operator bias. Although operators have attempted to minimize the error by taking a mean of multiple readings for the SR, this still does not take care of the area of selection. The second most frequently described method (3 studies) is the SAR [stiff areas as blue pixels (145 to 180 pixel area)/ lymph node area as ROI pixels]. 8,26,34 However, this requires another image analysis software (Image J) to calculate the stiff (blue) areas. It requires obtaining JPEG images or video clips for the software. Addition of another software for image analysis increases the procedure complexity, increasing the reporting times, and this impacts the real-life clinical utility of this method. 8 One study used a BCP based on a similar principle, but the software (Photoshop CS5) for the purpose was different. A multicenter study and a previous publication by 1 group explored the strain histogram method (2 studies) based on the mean strain. 15,32 However, the cutoffs of the mean strain in the 2 studies were different. A combination of mean strain, node size, and PET-CT fi ndings improved accuracy. In this method, examined lymph node showed elastography color dispersion in the ROI and provided the mean tissue elasticity. The blue color corresponded to a value of 0 and red color corresponded to a value of 255. Lymph nodes with more strain were suggestive of benignity and showed histograms with higher mean strain values.\nHowever, this method showed low diagnostic accuracy as compared with the other methods. The frequency histograms and blue proportion are less variable ( < 10%) than the SR (30.8%). 31 Qualitative versus quantitative method did not in fl uence the heterogeneity in sensitivity in our meta-analysis. Both methods have been found to be comparable in some studies where both techniques were used. 23\nAll the described methods of elastography have signi fi cant limitations. As has been reported by various authors, the high negative and positive predictive values of elastography do not underscore the need to obtain tissue for a de fi nitive diagnosis. The technology may aid in choosing a node for sampling if multiple nodes are involved, for selecting a speci fi c area for sampling, and to reduce the number of passes. 21 Despite these limitations, data indicate that elastographic features are more sensitive than B mode ultrasound features alone. Ideally, a combination of elastography with B mode features gives a superior diagnostic accuracy. 7,21,26 Lin et al 28 also observed that B mode features such as central necrosis in fl uence the accuracy of elastography for malignancy. Increased speci fi city and PPV for malignancy have also been reported when elastography is combined with PET-CT. 30\nOverall, the analysis found an NLR of 0.12, which indicates that the test could reasonably exclude malignancy when it is negative. However,\nthe PLR is 4.3 (usually an LR+ > 10 is associated with a large and signi fi cant increase in disease probability with a positive test result), thereby indicating the possibility of FP results. Hence, the pooled estimates are not strong enough to replace the actual sampling of the lymph nodes. Even with relatively high speci fi city and sensitivity, the PLR is low, making this test prone to FP results. In the common scenario where Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is being performed to diagnose or stage a lung cancer, the information that this test provides will not change the bronchoscopists ' choice of which lymph nodes to biopsy. There are certain limitations in this meta-analysis. Only 1 parameter was included per study for pooled analysis. Second, the pooled data have signi fi cant heterogeneity in terms of the diagnostic cutoffs and the gold standard. The elastography procedure itself has inherent limitations such as the amount of pressure used while generating the images, the selection of the perinodal area for estimation of SR, and multiple components of subjective interpretation. We did not publish the metaanalysis protocol in advance. In systematic reviews and meta-analysis, it may be useful to compare the outcomes reported in the manuscript against those in the protocol to check for outcome reporting bias. However, we did not observe deviations from the preplanned analyses.",

      "content": "algorithms and software of different manufacturers vary, thereby limiting the generalizability of the results. A standard algorithm across manufacturers may be ideal.\nAs there was a possible effect of the method of sedation on speci fi city, a standardized protocol should be used for the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA procedure. Elastography fi ndings are likely to be affected by a coughing or a lightly sedated patient as compared with an immobile comfortable fi eld. The results should be available in real time to the operator without the delay of image processing using additional software. Most of the studies on elastography are single-center studies with a speci fi c patient pro fi le. Many have included only lung cancer and excluded the other conditions. Prospective multicenter studies, including a variety of disease conditions, with large sample sizes are required for validation. None of the studies has evaluated the elastography characteristics during EUS-B-FNA, and future research should also include this. The protocol for selecting an ROI should preferably be automated as this is a signi fi cant cause for heterogeneity in calculations. Also, apart from lung cancer, other malignant causes of lymphadenopathy should be validated. The consistency of performance at all lymph node stations needs to be con fi rmed. Some authors have described dif fi culty at the 4R station, especially in patients with mediastinal fat. The protocol should work on dynamic images rather than a static protocol so that it is not an individual static image, but a composite of pictures that are interpreted. One of the arguments made in favor of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography is the potential to save time by selecting out the likely benign lymph nodes and limiting the number of stations that need to be biopsied. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is not necessarily a time-consuming procedure and even a full mediastinal survey can be conducted in a reasonable amount of time. 37\nFinally, the validation against a surgical gold standard will be ideal in nondiagnostic EBUSTBNA. Many studies included the results of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA as the gold standard, which is not appropriate for validation of new technology. Prediction models may need to be created incorporating the clinical and imaging data to improve the diagnostic accuracy.\nThe data presented in the meta-analysis highlight the need for more standardization in terms of technology to improve test discrimination and limit operator dependence. The results do not support any change in standard clinical practice. In the current\nform, standalone elastography may not be suf fi cient to exclude malignancy or con fi rm benignity.",
