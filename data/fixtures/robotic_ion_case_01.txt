Ion robotic bronchoscopy, normal airway exam, navigated to anterior segment right lower lobe. 
Initial rEBUS showed no signal. Performed Cios spin for repositioning. After adjustment, 
obtained concentric radial EBUS signal. Repeat 3D spin confirmed tool-in-lesion. 
Sampling performed with 23G needle x 5 passes (ROSE positive for malignant cells), 
followed by cryobiopsy using 1.1mm probe x 3 samples with 6 second freeze time.
No pneumothorax on immediate post-procedure imaging. Minimal bleeding controlled with suction.
Total procedure time 45 minutes. EBL < 5 mL.
