Silicone stents were deployed via rigid bronchoscopy and came in different shapes (bronchial, tracheal, tracheobronchial Y, and hourglass) and sizes. This followed with the adaptation of self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) from the gastroenterology and their subsequent use within the tracheobronchial tree. Over the past few years, stent technology has rapidly matured. Advancements in biomedical engineering have given rise\nto patient-specific 3D printed stents (PS3DS). Although new stents are regularly introduced to the existing market, a 'universally accepted' stent has yet to be developed (2). Like fingerprints, no two tracheobronchial diseases manifest alike, and the airway has dynamic motion with inspiration, expiration, and cough. Due to these intricacies, mass manufactured stents may not be the ideal solution for all patients or even groups of patients. Precision medicine focuses on optimizing efficiency or therapeutic benefit for a particular group of patients; it is being heavily researched in the disciplines of cardiology and oncology (3,4).

Patient-\n## irway anatomy\nA tracheobronchial tree is unique for each person. It varies based on the age, gender, and height of an individual. Normal tracheal diameter ranges from 16-20 millimeters (mm) and the length 10-14 centimeters (cm). The trachea has a unique 'D' shape on a cross-section with a flat membranous posterior wall and a cartilaginous anterior arch. The right main bronchus length is shorter than the left main bronchus (1. 5 vs. 4. 5 cm). This is due to the more proximal take off the right upper lobe in comparison to the left upper lobe. Both main bronchi range between 8-12 mm in diameter. As no two tracheobronchial trees are exactly alike, it is challenging to find a perfectly matching tracheobronchial stent when disease can alter all the dimensions differently. Patient-specific 3D printed airway stents are typically considered in complex airway disorders, which are a heterogeneous group of pathologies.

Airway narrowing or obstruction can produce a variety of respiratory symptoms\nthat can range from mild respiratory distress to profound respiratory failure and death. The compromise of airways can be due to benign or malignant processes. Examples of benign pathology include subglottic stenosis (post-intubation or due to inflammatory disorders such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis or sarcoidosis), tracheal or bronchial stenosis, tracheobronchomalacia, excessive dynamic airway collapse, non-malignant fistulas (tracheoesophageal, bronchoesophageal, or bronchopleural), or anastomotic complications amongst lung transplantation recipients (5). Malignancy related airway obstruction can occur in primary lung cancer as well as metastatic disease (breast cancer, colon cancer, sarcoma, melanoma, renal cell cancer, etc. ). Malignant airway obstruction can arise due to extrinsic compression, endobronchial obstruction, or a combination of both processes (6). ## urrent airway stenting practice patterns\nManagement of diseases compromising the tracheobronchial tree is highly viable and predicated on several factors: local practice pattern, equipment availability, operator preference and experience, etc. Often, treatment mandates frequent airway evaluation with bronchoscopy and interventions to recapture the airway such as sequential balloon dilation, mechanical debulking, non-mechanical debulking with a variety of tools (thermal, laser, or cryotherapy-based ablation modalities), and stent placement for airway stabilization.", "token_count": 351, "start_char": 1984, "end_char": 3662, "policy_version": "2", "issues": []}

The stent plays the role of airway maintenance to enable proper ventilation of the lung parenchyma beyond the stricture in malignant airway disease and to enable proper healing with minimization of the narrowed area of the airway in a benign airway disease. Stent matching of the malformed anatomy is critical to minimize the friction effect between the stent and the mucosa. Undue friction can to granulation tissue formation, and subsequent restenosis. Interventional pulmonologists have been facing complex airway disease and implanting various tracheobronchial stents for decades. In current practice, silicone and SEMS are the two main groups of airway prostheses. Both can achieve airway patency and maintain ventilation of the lung parenchyma for a time. Without a precise fit into the area, complications can arise with either type of stent: plugging with or without concurrent infection ( Figure 1 ), metal fatigue leading to fracture ( Figure 2 ), migration ( Figure 3 ), formation of granulation tissue ( Figure 4 ), and mucosal incorporation with possible erosion and perforation ( Figure 5 ) (7).", "token_count": 301, "start_char": 3336, "end_char": 4772, "policy_version": "2", "issues": []}

Silicone stents and SEMS have individual advantages and disadvantages ( Table 1 ). There are a number of biophysical interactions that can have an adverse effect on the stentairway interface. Self-expanding metallic stents are not static in size. Their lengths can change under compression through a phenomenon known as foreshortening. Coughing can cause mucosal trauma from the movement of wire edges which eventually can lead to granulation tissue formation (8). Suboptimal pressure distribution can also cause damage to airway mucosa by impeding microcirculation and fibroblast proliferation (9). In some cases, the unequal pressure can lead to mucosal erosion and associated airway perforation. Scar tissue and tumor respond differently to the expandable pressure generated by dilation of a stent. A stenosis may reopen easily with an expansile force but may not be able to resist compression due to adjacent tumor growth, this phenomenon is seen usually when balloon bronchoplasty is applied at the narrowed airway. Following dilation of the airway, there is a tendency to re-collapse due to external pressure from an extraluminal mass.", "token_count": 305, "start_char": 4425, "end_char": 5914, "policy_version": "2", "issues": []}

Following dilation of the airway, there is a tendency to re-collapse due to external pressure from an extraluminal mass. This balance of viscoelastic factors is a complex, but an important interaction between the stent and the airway. The silicone stent is cheaper when compared SEMS. Typically, they come in straight and Y varieties. The Y silicone stent is more predisposed to mucus build up, which can lead to plugging and infection. Straight silicone stents are more likely migrate when compared to their metallic counterparts (10). Due to its configuration, the Y silicone stent tends to migrate less when compared to their straight counterparts. For proper maintenance, silicone stents typically require, medication to help with mucus clearance, frequent surveillance bronchoscopies with stent revision (11,12). Due to the materials used for production and the manufacturing process, SEMS are more expensive. When deployed, these stents expand within the airway. The expansive force must be optimized to reduce the risk of complications. T oo much expansive radial force can cause tissue injury due to mucosal ischemia, while too little (or too much) can lead to stent migration (13).

Metal fatigue and stent metal fragmentation are not uncommon phenomena (7,12). Stent deployment must be performed with care as the SEMS can follow the path of least resistance (nonstenotic airway segment) rather than staying engaged in the stenotic area ( Figure 3 ). Although the SEMS that are currently available on the market comes in a variety of sizes, the problem of size mismatching between tracheobronchial is still encountered by many interventional pulmonologists (2). One of the options is to customize manufactured silicone stents to accommodate with the airway anatomy. These adjustments include cutting the silicone stent to fit the airway narrowing and avoid coverage of the main lobar outlets, using intussusception technique to extend the stent length to cover a larger area of stenosis (14), and suturing two different types of silicone stents together (Y stent and\nbronchial straight stent) to better approximate the size and length of the main bronchus ( Figure 6 ).

The pioneers of 3D printing include Dr. Kodama, Charles Hull, and Charles Deckard. The application of 3D printing in medicine is not a novel concept. The medical industry accounts for over a quarter of the applications of 3D printing amongst various fields (15). Initially used for prototyping, 3D printing is now used to manufacture prosthesis, instruments, implants, and artificial organs for research purposes. With the right equipment and expertise, 3D printing can allow point-of-care fabrication of customized implants, including airway stents. It must be kept in mind that the variability of build processes and high degree of customizability pose challenges to meeting regulatory standards and quality assurance (16). Conventional design validation for custom 3D printed airway stents is both labor and cost intensive. As an alternative, finite element analysis (FEA) can be used to predict the mechanical performance of a virtual device model (17). The use of FEA avoids the sacrifice of the printed device that would occur during conventional mechanical testing. The acceptance of conventional design validation by FEA has not been expressed by the United\nStates Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) (16).", "token_count": 307, "start_char": 7972, "end_char": 9514, "policy_version": "2", "issues": []}

The acceptance of conventional design validation by FEA has not been expressed by the United\nStates Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) (16). At present, very little guidance exists for quality assurance of 3D printed implantable devices. There are several key post-printing processes that are essential to the creation of any 3D printed medical device. Post-manufacturing processing is needed for any 3D printed stent. The method and materials used are dependent on the printing process that was utilized. Tumblers, sandblasting, or air-blasting may be needed. The International Organization of Standards (ISO) has published their standards for assessment of biocompatibility of medical devices, ISO 10993 (18). This 68-page document outlines the regulatory standards that must be followed for any device that will be directly or indirectly making contact with the body. Airway stents are considered class III devices by the USFDA (19). For class III devices, the USFDA has adopted and enforced the ISO recommendations. Sterilization is also an important process that cannot be overlooked with 3D printing. The probability of a single unit being non-sterile after it has undergone sterilization is known as the sterility assurance level (SAL). The material used for printing, the availability of sterilization processes, and the interaction between the sterilization process and the printed material dictate the type of process used.", "token_count": 306, "start_char": 9257, "end_char": 10807, "policy_version": "2", "issues": []}

The material used for printing, the availability of sterilization processes, and the interaction between the sterilization process and the printed material dictate the type of process used. The melting point of some printing materials (such as PCL) is below the temperature of conventional sterilization processes such as steam and ethylene oxide gas. A consensus strategy for the validation of sterility is yet to be developed. At present, the USFDA is also considering sterilization and subsequent reuse of 3D printed implantable medical devices (16). Whether such\nprocesses will be approved is yet to be determined; their applicability to PS3DS will likely be limited due to the patient-specific nature of the stent design. ## printing process\nPresently, the majority of 3D printing within medicine is for creating surgical guides and surgical planning (20). The application of 3D printing for custom implants (including airway stents) is still in its infancy. 3D printers have undergone significant enhancements in the current century. Unfortunately, there has been a delay in implementing this technology in pulmonary medicine; specifically, in the realm of PS3DS. A major barrier that contributed to this delay was the inability of the end-user (i. e. , an interventional pulmonologist) to easily create a platform for the design and manufacturing of a PS3DS.", "token_count": 301, "start_char": 10481, "end_char": 11981, "policy_version": "2", "issues": []}

A major barrier that contributed to this delay was the inability of the end-user (i. e. , an interventional pulmonologist) to easily create a platform for the design and manufacturing of a PS3DS. Another bottleneck has been finding the optimal printing material that allows for easy deployment within the airway and counteracts luminal pressure to maintain airway patency. The current technology used in 3D printing are the stereolithography, selective laser sintering (SLS), MultiJet modeling, and fused deposition modeling. The procedural details and materials needed vary from method to method. The US Food and Drug Administration approved multiple materials for medical 3D printing: polycaprolactone (PCL),\npolylactic acid (PLA), and poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA). These materials can be used alone or combined together to manufacture the final product. The mechanical characteristics of the printed device depend on the mixture ratio of PLA and PLGA. In addition to biocompatibility, both materials are biodegradable (21). During the initial steps, CT subtraction imaging is used to create the platform for the prototype that will be used in the 3D printer. The CT chest imaging is used to create a 3D virtual model by calculating a centerline for the patient airway. Using this as a platform, the interventional pulmonologist is able to form a PS3DS ( Figure 7 ).", "token_count": 320, "start_char": 11658, "end_char": 13161, "policy_version": "2", "issues": []}

Using this as a platform, the interventional pulmonologist is able to form a PS3DS ( Figure 7 ). The build of the 3D prototype starts by subtracting the data from the CT chest images and generating an image structure segmentation as digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM). The DICOM file is then converted to a standard tessellation language (STL) file generated by a computer-aided design program. The STL file can be used by the 3D printer to design the stent into several layers that range between 0. 005 to 0. 013 mm in thickness. The costs of PS3DS can also vary widely. Overhead costs include the printer itself and the materials used for development of the prosthesis. Overall, the price per stent is difficult to estimate due to the wide variance of the costs for the process as a whole: printer, printing material,\nimaging, practice prints, designing software, computer, and dedicated time. It is yet to be determined if PS3DS is a cost-effective option. ## printing landscape in present day\nWhen compared to other subspecialties, interventional pulmonology in its adolescence.

The current data regarding PS3DS is limited to a small number of case reports. The first published use of an airway PS3DS was in France. A PS3DS was used successfully in a patient with a complete stenosis of their bronchus intermedius with partial dehiscence of the bronchial anastomosis in their lung allograft (22). The patient in the study reported an immediate improvement in symptoms, there were no reported complications. Gildea and colleagues were the first to use a PS3DS in a human being. They later published their one-year experience with PS3DS in two patients with airway disease due to granulomatosis with polyangiitis (23); the report was the first of its kind in the United States. Both stents were removed after one year in order to deviation\nfrom standard of care with silicone stones and to comply with the obtained USFDA compassionate use exemption.

Overall, there is a large gap in medical literature pertaining to PS3DS. There is no published outcome comparison data between PS3DS and standard airway stents (26). ## uture directions\nWith biomedical engineering evolving at a rapid rate, we anticipate the use of PS3DS to become more widespread. Technological advancement will make printing more widely available, faster, and cheaper. Patient-specific short tracheal cannulas can be developed from data from derived purely from imaging (27). We anticipate that with continued improvement with imaging and printing, PS3DS will be able to be printed to match the patient's airway with extreme precision. Work is being undertaken to better optimize the stent-airway interaction with PS3DS. The ability to predict and test forces of the adjacent airway on the stent itself would be a major advancement in the field. A group from Spain has proposed a system of computer-based mathematical optimization of a stent. Unfortunately, it is not sustainable due to the high demand on processing power and expertise. Mitigation of infection risk with PS3DS is another arena of research. A variety of methods have been proposed, but their feasibility and ability to gain approval by regulatory bodies remains in question: bactericidal agent incorporation into the printing material or stent coating, combination of hot fused filament techniques or injection mold technique with a wet printing or electrospinning, and incorporation of antibiotics into polymers (28).", "token_count": 354, "start_char": 15216, "end_char": 17006, "policy_version": "2", "issues": []}

To add another facet of complexity, the development of drug eluting stents is possible and has some potential advantages: reduction of granulation tissue formation and inhibition of tumor ingrowth. At this juncture, manufacturing is technically feasible, but it would be fraught with regulatory challenges. Once a drug is embedded, any stent is seen as a pharmaceutical product and not an implantable medical device (29). This would open the stent to the rigorous and more robust regulatory procedures faced by pharmaceutical products, and not simply a medical device. Airway stents are rarely implanted with the intention\nof being permanent. Biodegradable stents are currently available for use in the cardiovascular system (30). In the future, it is possible that similar technology may cross over into pulmonary medicine. Freitag and colleagues are developing and testing biodegradable airway stents in animal models (28). For optimal effect, the degradation time constants of these stents have to be well-studied as erratic and unpredictable dissolution can have adverse impacts on the airway.

Keywords: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; emphysema; lung reduction\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) is the third leading cause of mortality in the United States with 15. 4 million physician visits, 1. 5 million emergency department visits, and 726,000 hospitalizations each year (1). Patients with advanced emphysema, one of the diseases that comprises Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are characterized by hyperin fl ation that precipitates breathlessness and predisposes\nindividuals to exacerbations and has a greater negative impact on health status than self-reported cardiovascular disease and diabetes (2, 3).

Many surgical procedures have been devised to treat this disease including costochondrectomy, phrenic crush, pneumoperitoneum, pleural abrasion, surgical lung denervation, and thoracoplasty. But apart from lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), bullectomy, and lung transplantation all others have not proven to be viable (4). LVRS has been extensively studied, and in appropriately selected patients reduces hyperin fl ation improving lung function, dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and long-term survival (5 -7). However, LVRS is underused because of concerns about the invasiveness of the procedure, increased associated perioperative morbidity and mortality, and narrow patient eligibility criteria (8 -10). Zephyr Endobronchial Valves (Zephyr EBV, Pulmonx Corporation) are small duckbill valves inserted bronchoscopically into the lung to occlude an emphysematous lobe.

The overall mean change in target lobe volume radiographically determined by highresolution CT at 12 months was a reduction of 1. 14 L, which corresponded to a mean reduction in RV of 0. 5 L (or a 10. 38% decrease from baseline). TLVR and consequent reduction in RV are consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of EBV and are comparable with changes after LVRS (25).

An additional important outcome in LIBERATE is the strong signal for the potential to reduce respiratory failure and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations requiring hospitalization in the longer term, both being important goals of therapy for these patients. Taken together with the previous demonstration of its effectiveness in patients with both heterogeneous (14, 15, 17) and homogeneous (15, 16) emphysema selected for little to no collateral ventilation, unilateral EBV treatment now provides a\nviable treatment option for a group of patients with emphysema that is currently lacking. Unlike surgery or other bronchoscopic interventions (33 -36) EBVs are readily removable, allowing the procedure to be reversed if a patient does not respond or has complications. The 27% frequency of pneumothorax SAEs in the treatment period is consistent with previous studies (16, 17) and the occurrence of pneumothorax does not seem to negatively impact clinical outcomes as seen in this study and previously reported by Gompelmann and coworkers (26) and Kemp and coworkers (17).", "token_count": 341, "start_char": 38898, "end_char": 40560, "policy_version": "2", "issues": []}

Seventy-six percent of the pneumothoraces occurred within 3 days after the most recent bronchoscopy (index procedure for those who did not have a secondary bronchoscopy), and 85% were within 5 days after the most recent bronchoscopy procedure. These statistics support a minimum 3-day hospital stay after EBV procedure to ensure timely management of a pneumothorax if it occurs. As in previous studies, the speci fi c algorithm for managing pneumothorax after EBV procedures developed by experts (22) was used to manage this consequence of the procedure during the present study and highlights the need for physicians performing\nthis procedure to have expertise in the management of procedural complications. One pneumothorax-related death at 13 days post-EBV procedure underlines the need to provide patients with clear instructions on recognizing symptoms of a pneumothorax and to seek emergent help if experiencing these symptoms. The study has certain limitations. First, although many subjects did not meet the very strict inclusion/exclusion criteria that included baseline lung function measures, prior medical history, and so forth, 40% (280/706) of the screen failures were related to destruction score and heterogeneity requirements, the thresholds for which were arbitrarily chosen at the time the study was designed.", "token_count": 332, "start_char": 40257, "end_char": 41889, "policy_version": "2", "issues": []}

Subsequent experience with homogenous patients in other trials (15, 16) has established the applicability of this therapy to a broader population. Similarly, the inclusion of subjects with little or no collateral ventilation was limited to their assessment with Chartis, which uses physiologic measures of air fl ow and airway resistance for assessing collateral ventilation status. The more recent evolution of novel quantitative CT (QCT) techniques now enables the noninvasive screening of subjects for collateral ventilation, with immediate exclusion of subjects with less than 80% complete fi ssure on QCT, Chartis requirement only in subjects with greater than 80% to less than 95% complete fi ssure on QCT, and treatment with EBV of subjects with greater than 95% complete fi ssure on QCT without Chartis (37, 38). This approach could have streamlined the screening out of subjects with completely absent fi ssures and perhaps reduced some screening bronchoscopies in this study.

These dual criteria were too restrictive and prevented many subjects from potentially bene fi tting from a revision procedure. In clinical practice (20), repeat bronchoscopies for valve revision are performed based on clinical judgment if a patient has a lack of clinical response or experiences a sudden late loss of bene fi t. The observed bene fi t to risk pro fi le of EBVtreatment must be assessed considering the limited treatment options for patients\nwith severe emphysema.

Speci fi cally, 90-day mortality after EBV is lower than LVRS with a rate of 3. 1% compared with 5. 0% in the LVRS non-high-risk group (39). Although the risks associated with LVRS are considered acceptable, this approach remains relatively underused (40). The only other remaining alternative of lung transplantation has a limitation of strict patient eligibility superimposed over the limited availability of donor lungs (41). ## onclusions\nZephyr EBV treatment in carefully selected patients with little or no collateral ventilation in the target lobe provides clinically meaningful and statistically signi fi cant bene fi ts in lung function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life over current SoC medical therapy out to at least 12 months. The bene fi ts are comparable with those seen with LVRS but with a reduction in post-procedure morbidity.

Metal stents can be placed using flexible bronchoscopy under local anesthesia but may be difficult to remove. Silicone stents require rigid bronchoscopy and general anesthesia to place but they are relatively easy to remove. A new hybrid stent, the AERO stent (Alveolus Inc, Charlotte, NC), has a completely covered nitinol framework. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this new hybrid stent for the treatment of malignant airway obstruction. Methods: This was a prospective multicenter intention to treat study. Eligible patients with malignant airway obstruction underwent self-expanding hybrid stent placement at 11 centers between June 2005 and December 2006. Patients were evaluated immediately postprocedure and at 7, 30, and 90 days postprocedure. Ease of deployment was assessed on a 4-point Likert scale.

Key Words: malignant central airway obstruction, stent, lung cancer\n( J Bronchol 2008;15:221-224)\nT racheobronchial stent placement has become a routine palliative modality for malignant airway obstruction. The goal is to improve airway lumen patency and quality of life. There are in general 2 classes of stents, silicone and metal. Silicone stents have been available and routinely used since the 1980s. 1,2 They are usually placed using a rigid bronchoscope, under general anesthesia, in the operating room. They have both positive and negative attributes. Advantages of silicone stents include the fact that there is much published data on their use. They are efficacious and inexpensive. In addition, these stents can be removed if needed. The disadvantages include: a need for general anesthesia and a trip to the operating room. In addition, granulation tissue formation around the stent and mucous formation within the stent is common. Self-expanding metal stents, usually made up of nitinol frame that has shape memory, became popular in the 1990s.", "token_count": 314, "start_char": 2076, "end_char": 3535, "policy_version": "2", "issues": []}

The stent is completely covered with a biocompatible membrane, which minimizes the possibility of tissue in-growth and granuloma formation. A hydrophilic coating in the inner lumen of the stent shall minimize mucous adherence and accumulation. Because the device is cut from a tube of nitinol with a unique design, the stent does not foreshorten or elongate upon delivery. The stent has a slightly larger diameter near the distal and proximal ends (Figure 1). Both ends are slightly vaulted inwardly to minimize possible airway injury and the formation of granulation tissue at the stent edges. The stent is deployed with a preloaded dedicated delivery system. ## tudy End Points\nData were collected before bronchoscopy, immediately postbronchoscopy, and at a 7-day postimplant clinic visit.

Improvement in lumen patency was visually assessed by comparison of airway lumen diameter prestent and poststent implant. Success was defined by 50% reduction in stenosis. This assessment was independently confirmed by blinded investigators assessing prebronchoscopy and postbronchoscopy images. Quality of life was assessed using a Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) and Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI) 3 as a surrogate of quality of life measure. The TDI scores were indicative of improvement (positive integer), no change (score of 0), or deterioration (negative integer) in comparison to the BDI assessed before implant. A change in score of +1 or more indicates a clinically meaningful improvement. A change in score of /C0 1 or more indicates a clinically meaningful worsening of dyspnea. A 4-point Likert scale to indicate ease of use and deployment performance was also recorded with 1 being difficult to place and 4 being easy to place. ## ESULTS\nSixty-one stents were placed in 56 patients.

The self-expanding hybrid stent provided immediate palliation in nearly all patients with a reasonable complication rate.

The self-expanding hybrid stent could be placed in the bronchoscopy laboratory under conscious sedation (a strength of selfexpanding metallic stents 4 ) but could be easily removed when needed (a strength of the silicone stent 4 ). The rate of immediate palliation is consistent with other studies in which metallic stents have been used. 5 Early complication rates are also consistent with published literature. In a study of 82 patients with benign and malignant disease, 54. 8% of patients required additional procedures to control granulation tissue formation and disease recurrence (tumor in-growth) postimplant. 6 Another study which included 27 patients had an overall complication rate of 50%. Secretion retention in 18% of the patients required additional interventional procedures and 15% of the patients' experienced recurrent dyspnea from granulation tissue formation at the end of the stent. 7 In this study, we observed 3 instances of slight granulation tissue formation which did not require ablation, no instance of tumor in-growth and no occlusion by secretions, though larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. The rate of migration is higher than what one would see with metallic stents yet, within range of what is found with silicone stents.", "token_count": 307, "start_char": 9925, "end_char": 11458, "policy_version": "2", "issues": []}

We have reasons to believe that this goal can be accomplished. This study has several strengths. First, it was a prospective multicentered study that is rare for a trial, which evaluates airway stent technology. Second, many important clinical end points were captured. Improvement in luminal patency was blindly assessed. Dyspnea, a surrogate of quality of life, as assessed by the BDI/TDI, was evaluated prestent and poststent placement and complications were recorded out to 90 days. The study has some weaknesses, namely, that long-term follow-up beyond 90 days was not assessed. Not surprisingly in this cancer population, a number of patients died before the end of the study, though none were related to stent placement. Transitional dyspnea scores were not available for many of the patients at the 90-day follow-up due to inability to travel, entrance into hospice care, or loss to follow-up.

Additional studies are needed with a longer follow-up period to accurately assess this new stent technology. In summary, the initial experience with this new hybrid stent was positive. The device was easy to deploy, effective in palliating symptoms and, when indicated, was easy to remove. The complication rate was comparable with that reported in the literature and repeat procedures were rarely required. Further trials are needed to assess the long-term outcomes of this new hybrid stent. Preferably, a study should be conducted comparing the new modified stent versus other stent types. ## EFERENCES\n1. Westaby S, Shepherd MP.

By using 1% lignocaine, the risk of potential toxicity would be lower although it is still essential to carefully monitor the amount of lignocaine administered during FB. Another important benefit of a lower concentration would be the usage in patients with renal and hepatic dysfunction, as well as in patients with airway infl ammation and pediatric age group, as the dose would be minimized.

Th ese were multiple operators (consultants, fellows), variable duration of bronchoscopy, wide range of indications, and concomitant procedures. However,\nthey were equally distributed between the two groups. Th e other limitation could be the lack of widespread generalization of our results given the fact that IV sedation was not used while a vast majority of bronchoscopists use sedation. However, lack of sedation can also be regarded as a major strength of the study as it allowed a clear assessment of the cough severity by the patient in contrast to the previous study where the patients were sedated. 11 Th e other obvious strength of the study is the large sample size. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that 1% lignocaine is similar in effi cacy to 2% lignocaine for topical anesthesia during FB, at signifi cantly lower doses of lignocaine. Hence, 1% lignocaine should be the preferred concentration for topical anesthesia of the larynx and the tracheobronchial tree during FB. ## cknowledgments\nAuthor contributions: R.

This systemic review and meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of small-bore pigtail catheter (PC) drainage compared with that of large-bore chest tube (LBCT) drainage as the initial treatment approach for all subtypes of pneumothorax. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for observational studies and randomized controlled trials published up to October 9, 2017, that compared PC and LBCT as the initial treatment for pneumothorax. The investigative outcomes included success rates, recurrence rates, complication rates, drainage duration, and hospital stay. RESULTS: Of the 11 included studies (875 patients), the success rate was similar in the PC (79. 84%) and LBCT (82. 87%) groups, with a risk ratio of 0. 99 (95% CI, 0. 93 to 1. 05; I 2 1⁄4 0%).

In the spontaneous subgroup, PC drainage was associated with a signi fi -cantly shorter drainage duration (mean difference, /C0 1. 51 [95% CI, /C0 2. 93 to /C0 0. 09]) and hospital stay (mean difference: /C0 2. 54 [95% CI, /C0 3. 16 to /C0 1. 92]; P < . 001) than the LBCT group. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, results of the meta-analysis suggest PC drainage may be considered as the initial treatment option for patients with primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Ideally, randomized controlled trials are needed to compare PC vs LBCT among different subgroups of patients with pneumothorax, which may ultimately improve clinical care and management for these patients.

Pneumothorax can be categorized according to its etiology as primary spontaneous pneumothorax, secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, and iatrogenic or traumatic pneumothorax. Although a small spontaneous pneumothorax may resolve without treatment, for patients who are symptomatic (ie, signi fi cant dyspnea de fi ned as deterioration in usual exercise tolerance 2 ) and exhibit a larger pneumothorax (rim of air > 2 cm), simple aspiration or tube thoracostomy is necessary. 1 However, whether a smallbore pigtail catheter (PC) or a large-bore chest tube (LBCT) should be used as the initial treatment for pneumothorax remains controversial. For example, according to the American College of Chest Physicians\nDelphi consensus statement, 2 an LBCT (16F-28F) should be used for treating larger and unstable primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax; by contrast, the British Thoracic Society no longer recommends the use of the LBCT for primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax.", "token_count": 345, "start_char": 3155, "end_char": 4572, "policy_version": "2", "issues": []}

Due to the inconsistency and the paucity of evidence, substantial variations exist in the approaches used for the initial management of pneumothorax in clinical practice. 3 We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effectiveness of small-bore PC drainage compared with that of LBCT drainage as the initial treatment for different subtypes of pneumothorax. ## aterials and Methods\nThe study protocol was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. 4 This research was exempted from institutional review board approval because it used only existing, publicly available data.

However, publication bias might be undetected given the small number of included studies. ## iscussion\nOur meta-analysis revealed that PC drainage was as effective as LBCT drainage. Furthermore, compared\nwith the LBCT group, the PC group had shorter drainage duration and hospital stay in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax and fewer complications in patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Although the LBCT has been the dominant treatment of choice in pneumothorax patients for decades, in recent years, abundant literature has supported a paradigm shift toward the more routine use of PC for managing pneumothorax with varying severity. The advantages of a PC are smaller size, small incision, better patient comfort, and outpatient management. Some studies have suggested that PC drainage is cost-saving and may be a reasonable treatment approach for the fi rst episode of large spontaneous pneumothorax. 18,19 However, the disadvantage of a PC is the lower fl ow rate. 20,21 The gas fl ow rates through a chest tube are related to various factors, as illustrated in the Fanning equation. 22 Generally, air has minimal viscosity; therefore, a smallbore PC may be suf fi cient for most air leaks resulting from pure alveolar-pleural fi stula regardless of the classi fi cation of pneumothorax.", "token_count": 340, "start_char": 18972, "end_char": 20550, "policy_version": "2", "issues": []}

Conversely, the LBCT can be reserved for refractory pneumothorax and in the emergent scenarios. 13\nOverall, the pooled estimate of the RRs for the success rate indicated that PC drainage was as effective as LBCT drainage for the management of pneumothorax irrespective of the subtypes. In previous studies, the success rate of spontaneous pneumothorax has ranged from 65% to 88% for the PC group and 72% to 80% for the LBCT group. 17,19,23 With regard to the recurrence rate, we could only include four studies of spontaneous\n## unnel Plot of Standard Error by Log risk ratio\npneumothorax, 3,12,14,17 and the pooled results showed no statistically signi fi cant differences between the PC and LBCT groups.

Moreover, the frequency of drainage complications was higher in the failed cases of the LBCT group than in the failed cases of the PC group. This result suggests that PC drainage may be considered as an initial treatment of choice for patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax given that the complication rate was lower even in the failed cases. The present study reported highly signi fi cant reductions in drainage duration and length of hospital stay among patients with spontaneous pneumothorax who used a PC compared with those who used an LBCT.
